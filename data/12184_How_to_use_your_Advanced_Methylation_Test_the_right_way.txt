<p>That being said its now important that we followed up with you to help you understand, how to get the most out of it and learn just how important it really is to get the right information from your test results and apply those results the right way to get the most out of your investment so far, your ultimate health![/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text="Some important facts about your test you most likely have no idea about" font_container="tag:h3|text_align:left" google_fonts="font_family:Arvo%3Aregular%2Citalic%2C700%2C700italic|font_style:400%20regular%3A400%3Anormal"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]While the Advanced methylation test is very useful, unless you are a professional in the field of methylation and genetics you could be easily excused for not understanding how to use your test results in a more advanced way.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand about your test results is that they are 100% accurate because they know your gene mutations right?  Well, no, you see the problem with that idea is that the mutations themselves are not always active and therefore are not always going to influence you and or your health.</p>
<p>With that in mind, consider this....</p>
<p><strong>What your test results revealed about you is lacking a number of key factors that can be life changing.</strong>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text="Key factors that can be life changing" font_container="tag:h3|text_align:left" google_fonts="font_family:Arvo%3Aregular%2Citalic%2C700%2C700italic|font_style:400%20regular%3A400%3Anormal"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]The methylation/genetics test does not know you as a person, it knows nothing about your health, it knows nothing about your real methylation health, it knows nothing about your underlying health, it knows nothing about how your genes and your gene's mutations are playing out and it knows nothing about your family history.  <strong>That's a lot of missing information</strong>, far too much valuable, in fact vital information you really need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the most from your test results</li>
<li>Reverse underlying health problems</li>
<li>Get the most advantages from a more personal supplement protocol</li>
<li>Discover your real strengths and weaknesses and take leveraged advantage of these factors</li>
<li>Prevent a serious health problem from progressing and or reversing it completely</li>
<li>Learn about which advanced tests suit you best</li>
<li>Discover the right supplements and diet designed for you in a customized way</li>
</ul>

<p>After having understood methylation in practice for over 20 years and actively worked on genetics for over a decade, it doesn't take much for me to find, what people really want to know, to change their health for the better, using very precise and often little known advantages that can only be found in your genes.</p>
<p>Whenever I engage with a new client about their genetics and methylation, it doesn't take long for them to start to see the light, that finally the missing piece of their personal health puzzle becomes obvious and it's not uncommon for a client to say "I wish I found you 20 years ago".  That's just what happens when people hear the truth about what's been holding them back from being their best self.</p>
<p>Just to mention a few, here is what I find with real clients who consult with me about their methylation/genes:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of the time we find significant health problems even when there are no symptoms and we can reverse engineer them</li>
<li>They actually have no idea of the real status of their methylation cycle (is it good, is it bad)</li>
<li>They are often taking many supplements without any proof of what they really need</li>
<li>They don't really understand what a gene mutations is, if it's active or not and or how it's affects their health</li>
<li>They <strong>always</strong> have underlying health problems even if they have no symptoms</li>
<li>They didn't understand what their real risk factors are so they failed to prevent serious problems</li>
<li>They are <strong>always</strong> toxic at some level</li>
<li>They often have no idea of which diet will get them the best advantage even though many eat very clean</li>
<li>They follow generic advice that's not always the right advice for them</li>
<li>Once they consult with me, they get a much better and clear understanding, of how important this is, we do the right tests and apply the right treatment protocols <strong>they always see significant advantages that no other health practitioner has been able to do for them before, no matter the amount of money, effort or time</strong></li>
</ul>
