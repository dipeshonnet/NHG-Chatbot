"Hair Mineral Analysis Testing (HMA)",nutritional-balance-program,,105,"<h1 data-pm-slice=""1 1 []"">Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Sydney: Nutritional Balance Program</h1>
<strong>Don’t play guessing games with your health!</strong>

Our HMA (Hair Mineral Analysis) test is a nutritional balancing program that works at a deep level to re-balance your health!

When it comes to your personal health there is nothing more important than knowing what your body really needs to have optimal health and that’s what our nutritional balancing program does. Modern lifestyle factors, including the consumption of chemical food additives, can contribute to nutritional imbalances and health issues.

Everyone is unique and so are their needs for nutrients such as vitamins and minerals, so it is important to understand that randomly taking supplements and relying on poorly nourished foods puts you at a big disadvantage when it comes to having optimal balanced health.
<h3>Important facts about NOT knowing your nutritional status</h3>
Not knowing your current nutritional status is a big problem facing most people today, here are just some of the problems:
<ul>
 	<li>Nutritional problems lead to disease</li>
 	<li>Nutritional problems lead to poor health both physically and mentally</li>
 	<li>You take supplements without knowing if they will work for you</li>
 	<li>You spend money on supplements you don’t need</li>
 	<li>You take the wrong supplements that cause bigger health problems</li>
 	<li>You can’t know how to prevent health problems and disease</li>
 	<li>You lose time and money trying to solve health problems</li>
 	<li>You have to take medications to deal with your health problems</li>
 	<li>And many more</li>
</ul>
Our program is designed with just that in mind, <strong>knowing exactly what your body really needs to be healthy.</strong>  Because you are unique we want to know the current state of your health, this is done by taking a hair sample right from the comfort of your own home and sending it to our laboratory where we analyze your hair for nutritional problems.  Once this is done our professional, qualified nutritionists analyze the results and contact you via email with your results and the actions you need to take to re-balance your health. Hair testing allows for the detection of exposure to heavy metals and minerals, providing a comprehensive overview of your nutritional status.
<h3>What is Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)?</h3>
Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA) is a non-invasive pathology test that measures the levels and comparative ratios of nutrient and toxic minerals found in hair. This safe and scientific test provides valuable health information on the presence of both nutrient and toxic minerals in the body. HTMA is considered one of the most valuable screening tools available in everyday and preventative health care. Many doctors, naturopaths, and nutritional therapists regard HTMA as an essential tool for assessing current mineral status and recommending dietary changes and supplements for improved health and wellbeing. By analyzing hair tissue, HTMA offers a comprehensive overview of your body’s mineral balance, helping to identify potential deficiencies or toxicities that could impact your health.
<h3>Benefits and Importance of HTMA</h3>
HTMA offers numerous benefits and is essential for maintaining optimal health and wellbeing. It provides reliable data on over 35 nutrient and toxic minerals and 25 important mineral ratios, offering valuable health information not revealed in standard blood and urine tests. This detailed analysis can identify nutrient mineral imbalances or toxic mineral excesses that may be affecting your health. Personalized doctor interpretive test reports assess your current mineral status and recommend dietary changes and supplements for improved health and wellbeing. Additionally, HTMA is a useful tool for identifying exposure to heavy metals and minerals, particularly in cases where other testing methods are not available or are not reliable. By understanding your unique mineral profile, you can take proactive steps to address imbalances and enhance your overall health.
<h3>How HTMA Works</h3>
HTMA works by analyzing a hair sample, which is a body tissue made up of mostly dead, keratinized cells fused together. The shaft of the hair is the portion that projects from the skin’s surface, while the root of the hair, below the skin’s surface, contains living matrix cells from which the hair grows. Matrix cells depend on the blood supply for nourishment and growth, and as they grow and divide, minerals are keratinized into the growing hair shaft, creating a permanent record of metabolic activity and exposure to toxic elements. Research has shown that hair tissue is useful in indicating nutrient imbalances and exposure to toxic elements. By examining the mineral content of your hair, HTMA provides a snapshot of your body’s metabolic processes and exposure to various elements over time.

<h3>Nutritional Balancing with Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis</h3>
Hair tissue mineral analysis is an analytical test that measures the nutrient and toxic mineral content of hair. As the constituents of the hair are determined by the entry of substances from external sources and from substances that enter it from the bloodstream, hair makes an ideal medium for analysis. In cases where scalp hair is unavailable or potentially contaminated, pubic hair can be used as a viable alternative for accurate analysis. Levels of particular toxic and nutrient minerals can be used to diagnose behavioral disorders.

The mineral composition of hair reflects the mineral composition of the body’s tissues in that region during hair growth. If a mineral deficiency or excess exists in the hair, it can directly indicate a mineral deficiency, excess, or imbalance within surrounding tissues and the rest of the body. Essentially, human hair is a recording filament that can reflect metabolic status over medium to long periods of time. Therefore as a simple non-invasive diagnostic tool, hair analysis can provide an overview of post-nutritional and other metabolic events.

Since the structure of hair remains unchanged, the minerals are fixed in the hair, and levels in hair do not significantly change once that portion of hair has grown. The analysis accurately provides concentrations of minerals that have accumulated in the hair tissue over the hair growth period, approximately one to three months. Human head hair is a recording filament that can reflect metabolic changes.

Tissue mineral analysis is unique in that it inexpensively provides information directly about cellular activity, which is the main site of nutritional metabolism. As important as vitamins are, they can do nothing for the body without proper mineral intake. Vitamins cannot function and are unable to be assimilated without the aid of minerals.
<h2>Common Causes Of Nutritional Imbalance or Deficiencies</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Improper diet</li>
 	<li>Genetic or gene mutations</li>
 	<li>Excessive intake of refined carbohydrates or sugars</li>
 	<li>Strict Vegetarian Diet</li>
 	<li>Other exclusive diet/s</li>
 	<li>Work Conditions (Working in or with toxic elements)</li>
 	<li>Medication</li>
 	<li>Stress</li>
 	<li>Taking supplements, vitamins, and minerals <strong>not compatible with your body chemistry</strong></li>
 	<li>Occupation</li>
 	<li>Poor food quality</li>
</ul>
Even if you are not experiencing a problem, abnormal changes in body chemistry and nutritional deficiencies/excesses may result in early, subtle changes in your body such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Weight Gain (metabolism)</li>
 	<li>Behavior Disorders</li>
 	<li>White spots on fingernails</li>
 	<li>Longitudinal ridging on nails</li>
 	<li>Brittle fingernails, toenails, and hair (Calcium, Silica, and/or Copper imbalances)</li>
 	<li>Stretch Marks</li>
 	<li>Poor food taste</li>
</ul>
All of the above indicators and many more are generally signs of metabolic disturbances that can be detected in early to prevent disease.

&nbsp;
<h3>Hair Analysis vs Blood Testing</h3>
HTMA is a more accurate and reliable test than blood testing for measuring mineral levels in the body. Blood tests only measure minerals being transported around the body, whereas HTMA measures minerals stored in tissues. The body removes lead from blood as a protective measure and deposits it into tissues like the liver, bones, teeth, and hair, making blood tests less reliable for detecting heavy metal toxicity. Elevated serum lead levels may be undetectable 30-40 days after acute lead poisoning, whereas HTMA can detect minerals stored in tissues, including heavy metals. This makes HTMA a superior method for identifying long-term exposure to toxic elements and understanding your body’s mineral storage and utilization.

"Adrenal Fatigue Test",adrenal-fatigue-test,,350,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>
<h2>The Adrenal Fatigue Saliva Test</h2>
<a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/adrenal-fatigue-test-extensive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Also see the adrenal fatigue extensive test here.</a>

Do you suffer from stress?  Don't know why you're tired and fatigued most of the time?  It may be an adrenal fatigue problem....

Adrenal fatigue is a condition that can result from imbalances in one or two important hormones, DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) and Cortisol that are responsible for controlling how you respond to stress.  When one or both of these hormones becomes depleted that's when fatigue or adrenal insufficiency can result.

The adrenal fatigue saliva test is the most accurate and powerful non invasive hormone test that helps you to discover the true levels of these important hormones and be able to take actions to resolve adrenal fatigue helping to reduce stress and resolve many other associated problems.

<strong>The test focuses on checking the levels of both DHEA and Cortisol to determine irregularities.</strong>  The adrenal fatigue test uses your saliva to measure these important hormones which are laboratory verified and results are then checked by one of our professional health practitioners who provides the results and guidance on what to do with the results.
<h3>Do you have any of the signs of adrenal fatigue?</h3>
Adrenal fatigue can cause many different symptoms in your body and in many cases can cause serious harm if left unchecked.  It's important to check your adrenals if you have any of the following common symptoms:
<ul>
 	<li>Anxiety</li>
 	<li>Fibromyalgia</li>
 	<li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
 	<li>Headaches</li>
 	<li>Hypoglycemia</li>
 	<li>Hypotension</li>
 	<li>Poor concentration, ‘brain fog’</li>
 	<li>Energy levels</li>
 	<li>Fatigue, lethargy, consistent tiredness</li>
 	<li>Salt cravings</li>
 	<li>Depression</li>
 	<li>Lack of stamina</li>
 	<li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
 	<li>Irregular sleeping patterns</li>
 	<li>Thyroid dysfunction</li>
 	<li>Blood pressure problems</li>
 	<li>Depression</li>
 	<li>Impaired Immune System</li>
 	<li>Insomnia</li>
</ul>
<h3>About adrenal function, stress, adrenal problems and testing</h3>
The adrenal glans which are both located on top of your kidney's belong to the hormonal system or endocrine system.  Adrenal fatigue is a very common condition in today’s society through the physical and physiological demands we put on our adrenal glands. Each gland is composed of two distinct zones, the large outer cortex and the inner medulla.

The adrenal glans use two important hormones to help you control stress, these include DHEA and Cortisol which are used to maintain a healthy balance of stress response.  Therefore the adrenal fatigue test is considered a ""stress test"", this is because when a person experiences above average levels of stress the balances of these hormones can tell us if a person is in or at risk of fatigue or ""burn out"".  Understanding the true balances of these two hormones helps us to make educated decisions about how to restore good health and in many cases prevent more serious health problems.

In the case of adrenal fatigue or adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands run low of the balancing hormones and a loss of vital energy or ""burn out"" is experienced, often this condition cannot be resolved without first knowing the levels of DHEA and cortisol so that appropriate action can be taken to restore healthy function.  This test can also be helpful in the discovery of other underlying health problems that may need attention.

Testing the hormones produced by the adrenal glands serves as a critical tool for uncovering biochemical imbalances underlying many of the above mentioned symptoms.

Many of the adrenal function problems of today are related to a stressful lifestyle, nutritional problems/imbalances, environmental toxicity and poor diet.
<h3>The adrenal function saliva test process</h3>
The adrenal fatigue test can be done right from your home or work place, the test kit contains a full set of instructions and all equipment required to provide your sample for testing.

<h3>More about Kryptopyrrole, Mauve Factor, Pyroluria or Pyrrole</h3>
<a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/pfeiffer-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr. Carl Pfeiffer</a> who was one of the initial investigators of Mauve, treated more than one thousand high-Mauve patients with vitamin B6 and zinc with very positive results. Symptom improvement with these supplements can be experienced in patients in as little as two days and Mauve levels have been observed to decrease by as much as 50% after one month of treatment. However, discontinuation of the supplement regime may result in deterioration of the patient in as little as 48 hours. Correlation studies have provided evidence of <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/zinc-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">zinc</a> and functional vitamin B6 deficiencies in high-Mauve patients, supporting the use of these nutrients in the treatment of Mauve. Many of the symptoms observed in high-Mauve patients can be attributed to zinc, vitamin B6 and biotin deficiencies.  Furthermore, many <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/neurotransmitter-test-extensive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and GABA</a> require vitamin B6 and/or zinc for their production.  Zinc alone is responsible for the production of over 200 enzymes required for good health.

<h2>The Homocysteine Levels Test</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have you checked your homocysteine level? Your life may depend on it, as 1 out of every 2 people have high homocysteine levels!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Homocysteine is the chemical that is released into the body as a result of a process called methylation. It’s a normal process as long as the homocysteine your body produces is broken down into other useful, health-giving chemicals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When homocysteine becomes elevated, this is a warning sign that can result in any of the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li><p>Alzheimer's disease</p></li><li><p>Cardiovascular disease mortality</p></li><li><p>Chronic heart failure</p></li><li><p>Heart attack</p></li><li><p>Cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease</p></li><li><p>Stroke</p></li><li><p>Cancer</p></li><li><p>Diabetes</p></li><li><p>Death</p></li><li><p>Methylation imbalances</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing your homocysteine levels can mean the difference between life and death, literally. It’s also important to understand that by simply keeping your homocysteine in check, you can dramatically decrease your risk of many of the above health problems by as much as 50%.</p>

<h3>What Causes High or Elevated Homocysteine and Cardiovascular Disease?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Homocysteine in the body is produced from processing methionine, a natural amino acid, through methionine metabolism. Normally, homocysteine is broken down into two healthy beneficial chemicals called SAMe and glutathione, which solves the problem of having high or elevated homocysteine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several factors can cause elevated homocysteine, these include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li><p>Poor diet</p></li><li><p>Nutritional problems</p></li><li><p>Stress</p></li><li><p>Genetic inheritance. e.g. Family history of any of the above diseases</p></li><li><p>Folate deficiency</p></li><li><p>Male sex (increased risk)</p></li><li><p>Oestrogen deficiency</p></li><li><p>Excessive alcohol, coffee or tea intake</p></li><li><p>Smoking</p></li><li><p>Lack of exercise</p></li><li><p>Hostility and repressed anger</p></li><li><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, Chron’s disease)</p></li><li><p>Pregnancy</p></li><li><p>Being vegetarian or vegan</p></li><li><p>High salt intake</p></li><li><p>Hat fat diet with excessive red meat, high fat dairy intake</p></li>

<h3>How Homocysteine Works and the Role of Folic Acid</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the below diagram you can see the processes that break down homocysteine into SAMe and glutathione, any problems with either pathway leads to elevated or high levels of homocysteine. Homocysteine is one of the sulfur-containing amino acids produced during the metabolism of methionine.</p>

<h2>Understanding Homocysteine</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Homocysteine is a naturally occurring amino acid in the body, specifically a sulphur-containing amino acid. It plays a vital role in various bodily functions, particularly in the metabolism of methionine, an essential amino acid. However, when homocysteine levels become elevated, it can pose significant health risks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elevated homocysteine levels are a known risk factor for several serious health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Understanding how homocysteine works and the factors that can lead to elevated levels is crucial for maintaining good health and preventing these conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What is Homocysteine and Its Risks</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Homocysteine is a sulphur-containing amino acid that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. Elevated homocysteine levels have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Homocysteine is formed from the essential amino acid methionine, and its metabolism is dependent on folic acid, vitamin B12, and other B vitamins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When homocysteine levels are elevated, it can damage the lining of blood vessels, leading to blood vessel blockages and increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. Excess homocysteine can also promote atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maintaining healthy homocysteine levels is essential for preventing these serious health issues. Ensuring an adequate intake of folic acid, vitamin B12, and other B vitamins can help support proper homocysteine metabolism and reduce the risk of elevated levels. Regular monitoring through a homocysteine test can provide valuable insights into your cardiovascular health and help you take proactive steps to protect your well-being.</p>

<h2>The Cortisol Test</h2>
Do you have a problem with cortisol imbalance?

Cortisol is your bodies way of dealing with stress, too much of it indicates to much stress and to little indicates <span class=""sppc-e sppc-h"">adrenal insufficiency</span>.

Salivary cortisol testing is the most accurate and powerful non-invasive salivary hormone test that evaluates bioactive levels of the body’s important stress hormone cortisol. This hormone test consider to be a stress test serves as a critical tool for uncovering biochemical imbalances underlying anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, dysglycemia, and a host of other clinical conditions that may affect our day to day lives. This hormone test examines 4 saliva samples over a 12-hour period for levels of cortisol 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. The cortisol test is particularly useful for patients with fatigue.

<a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/adrenal-fatigue-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adrenal fatigue</a> is a very common condition in today’s society through the physical and physiological demands we put on our adrenal glands and or the levels of stress we experience.

<h3>Insomnia</h3>
<div data-canvas-width=""388.3319999999999"">Insomnia is defined as repeated difficulty with sleep initiation, maintenance, duration, and/or quality of sleep. This occurs despite adequate opportunity and time for sleep, and results in daytime impairment. Mild (transient or short-term) insomnia is known to affect between 30 - 50% of the general population, whilst chronic insomnia has a prevalence of 9 - 15%. This disorder affects energy levels, memory, concentration and problem solving skills. In addition, it has been linked to learning disabilities in children. Sleeplessness not only affects the individual but also produces social stress, lowered employee productivity, and a higher number of accidents. Therefore it is vital that the cause and treatment of insomnia is adequately addressed.</div>
<div data-canvas-width=""388.3319999999999""></div>
<h3 data-canvas-width=""388.3319999999999"">Melatonin, Anti-aging, and Sleep</h3>
<div data-canvas-width=""110.1056"">Melatonin is a peptide hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland from the amino acid tryptophan. It regulates the body’s circadian rhythms helping to control normal sleep patterns. It is highest in the body at night and lowest during the day. The synthesis of this hormone in humans is stimulated by darkness and suppressed by light. Melatonin supplementation has been used for assisting sleep in insomniacs, shift-workers and those dealing with jetlag. In addition, conditions that are associated with poor sleep, such as Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, are also assisted by melatonin use.</div>
<div data-canvas-width=""110.1056""></div>
<div>Results show that melatonin decreases the time to get to sleep (lag-phase), whilst increasing the amount of time a person stays asleep.</div>

<div data-canvas-width=""160.15359999999995""><a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/cortisol-test/"">Cortisol</a> is a glucocorticoid hormone that is essential for life. It is produced by the adrenal glands and is often referred to as the ""stress hormone"", since it is raised by stress and involved in the body’s response to it.</div>
<div data-canvas-width=""406.2903999999999""></div>
<div data-canvas-width=""698.3168"">Cortisol is involved in many functions of the body including central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, blood sugar regulation, and immune system modulation. When deficiencies or excess of this steroid hormone occur many symptoms and health conditions are experienced. Addison’s disease and Cushing’s disease are the most well-known conditions associated with cortisol deficiency and excess respectively. Although they are life-threatening</div>

<h2>The MTHFR Gene Mutation Blood Test</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MTHFR is the gene in genetics that has the job of making an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and genetic mutations in this gene can lead to various health issues. This enzyme plays an important role in processing amino acids which are the building blocks of the body. So when the MTHFR gene has a mutation, limited amounts of these important enzymes are produced leading to many serious health problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What is the MTHFR Gene?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MTHFR gene, also known as Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase, is a key enzyme required to metabolise homocysteine. This enzyme plays a crucial role in processing amino acids and converting homocysteine to methionine, which the body uses to make proteins and other important compounds. The MTHFR gene is essential for a chemical reaction involving forms of the B-vitamin folate. Mutations in the MTHFR gene, such as C677T and A1298C, can lead to elevated blood levels of homocysteine, which is a risk factor for various health conditions, including coronary artery disease, neural tube defects, and mood disorders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Important Facts About MTHFR Gene Mutation: Mood Disorders</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lowered L-methylfolate or folate levels is associated with symptoms and conditions such as mental health disorders and other mood disorders, cardiovascular disease, obesity and birth defects. Folate deficiency is a major contributor to high homocysteine levels in the blood, which can exacerbate these conditions. Genetic testing can ascertain whether an individual has one of the common polymorphisms which leads to a L-methylfolate deficiency, and can verify when supplementation of this special form of folate is warranted. The following are examples of the problems associated to the gene mutation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>The Main Problem With MTHFR: Folate Deficiency</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Folate is a water soluble B vitamin (B9), which humans cannot make in their body and is thus a dietary requirement. Folate deficiency can result from these mutations, leading to elevated homocysteine levels and associated health risks. The primary function of folate is the transfer of methyl and formyl groups. It is essential for cell growth and reproduction, the formation of certain amino acids (methionine, serine, glycine, and histidine), the breakdown of proteins (e.g. <a href=""http://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">homocysteine</a>), the formation of DNA and RNA, red blood cell maturation, and serotonin, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and dopamine formation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>MTHFR gene mutation makes it much harder for the body to use folate which causes problems for many of the normal chemical pathways of the body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What do we test for?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are testing for genetic mutations in the MTHFR gene, specifically the following mutations:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MTHFR C677T gene mutation MTHFR A1298C gene mutation</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Have any questions about this test?</strong>  <a href=""http://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/contact-us"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Ask one of our qualified health practitioners here.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Test Kit and Specimen Collection</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MTHFR gene test kit is a simple and non-invasive way to collect a specimen for testing. The kit can be ordered online and includes a buccal swab or a blood sample collection device. For a blood sample, the patient can take the request form to their nearest Clinical Labs pathology collection centre. For a buccal swab, the patient can collect the specimen at home. The specimen requirements are minimal, and the patient does not need to fast for this test if a blood sample is required. However, swab specimens should be collected in the morning before eating or drinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Test Process and Turnaround Time</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MTHFR gene test process involves sending the collected specimen to a laboratory for analysis. The standard turnaround time for this test is 10-14 business days. Once the testing is completed, the patient results are delivered to the referring practitioner via electronic download unless requested otherwise. Results can also be issued via hardcopy or fax.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Understanding Your Test Results</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The MTHFR gene test results will indicate whether the patient has a mutation in the MTHFR gene, such as C677T or A1298C. If the patient has two copies of the C677T mutation (homozygous), they are predisposed to developing high blood levels of homocysteine, particularly when their diets are low in folate. A second mutation in the MTHFR gene, A1298C, has also been implicated in high blood levels of homocysteine when found in conjunction with the C677T mutation. The test results will also indicate whether the patient may require supplementation due to certain mutations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Personalized Health Strategies</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the MTHFR gene test results, personalized health strategies can be developed to address any potential health risks associated with the mutation. This may include dietary changes, such as increasing folate intake, and supplementation with vitamins and minerals. The results of the MTHFR gene test in conjunction with the patient history and presenting complaints may also indicate the need for further testing, such as the Advanced Pathways Test, to identify other potential health risks. A healthcare practitioner can work with the patient to develop a personalized health plan to address any health concerns and prevent potential health issues.</p>

<h3>About Candida Albicans</h3>
<div data-canvas-width=""30.46218"">Although yeast is found in everyone’s GIT (Castro Intestinal Tract), problems arise when the ratio of friendly bacteria to harmful microorganisms is disturbed. A modern lifestyle including antibiotic and oral contraceptive use,</div>
<div data-canvas-width=""60.30582"">stress and high carbohydrate diets can either kill the friendly bacteria which then promote Candida growth or encourage Candida proliferation directly.</div>
<div data-canvas-width=""60.30582""></div>
<div data-canvas-width=""60.30582"">
<div data-canvas-width=""48.1473"">Multiple mechanisms may explain how Candida yeast infection can result in such a diverse set of systemic symptoms.  Candida overgrowth can give rise to local yeast infection symptoms as seen in thrush, vaginitis, and skin irritations. However, alcohol and toxins released into the bloodstream by Candida can also produce negative effects. These toxins may lead to the characteristic ‘brain fog’ and in extreme cases may cause ‘the drinkless drunk’</div>
<div data-canvas-width=""64.07196"">(individuals who have high blood alcohol and symptoms of drunkenness without consuming alcohol).</div>
<div data-canvas-width=""14.308769999999999""></div>
<div data-canvas-width=""28.002660000000002"">In addition, Candida infections may weaken the immune system and increase the permeability of the GI mucosal lining. These effects can lead to food intolerance and therefore symptoms such as headaches, asthma, muscle, and joint pains as well as irritable bowel.</div>

<h2>The Intestinal Permeability And Leaky Gut Urine Test</h2>
The Leaky Gut Syndrome Test is a precise, non invasive urine test for evaluating the permeability of the intestinal wall.  Changes in intestinal permeability are associated with many health conditions including autism, autoimmune disorders, food sensitivities and inflammatory bowel disease or inflammatory bowl syndrome (IBS).  This ‘leaky gut’ causes disease because the damaged intestinal lining allows toxic molecules and undigested foods to enter the bloodstream and poison the body, further the damaged lining also causes malabsorption of essential nutrients.
<h3>About the Intestinal Permeability And Leaky Gut Urine Test</h3>
The Intestinal permeability and leaky gut test is a simple urine test that can be done from home or work place.  The test measures the levels of lactulose and mannitol which are reliable indicators for determining a leaky gut.

The test kit contains:
<ul>
 	<li>All the equipment needed to complete the test</li>
 	<li>A full set of instructions</li>

<h3>About Leaky Gut</h3>
Among non-communicable diseases, <strong>intestinal permeability (leaky Gut) also called (metabolic endotoxemia) is the number 1 leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (so take this test now).</strong> Metabolic endotoxemia is a condition that stems from dysbiosis and a breakdown of intestinal barrier function.  Intestinal permeability is present in most chronic diseases and is believed to be the major driver of many conditions.
<div data-canvas-width=""716.6484000000002"">The gastrointestinal tract has two main functions; a) to digest and absorb important nutrients for the body’s growth and function, and b) to act as a barrier to keep harmful solutes, luminal antigens, and microorganisms from entering the blood. When the integrity of this complex system is disturbed and intestinal permeability exists, ill-health can easily develop (see Table 1 below). Many conditions such as autoimmune disorders, autism, food sensitivities, inflammatory bowel disease, and jaundice are associated with increased intestinal permeability, which is also known as ‘leaky gut’ (see Table 1 below).</div>

<h3>The Importance of Having Balanced Female Hormones</h3>
Female hormones are crucial to a woman’s reproductive health. The main hormones affecting the menstrual cycle and fertility are produced by glands in the brain and by the ovaries. Those hormones regulate menstruation, fertility and sex drive, any one of which can be adversely affected if the production of these hormones goes out of balance, further hormonal changes gradually cause reproductive organs to shut down eventually leading to menopause and female hormone imbalance symptoms.  Apart from those important points, female hormones also help to maintain good health and have anti-aging properties.  Despite popular belief menopause and menopause symptoms can also be reversed.
<h3>Estrogen Deficiency, Osteoporosis and Menopause</h3>
In addition to the symptoms listed above, osteoporosis and memory loss are also common problems associated with menopause or the loss of vital hormone production, as estrogen hormones decrease in the case of estrogen deficiency other factors come into play such as slowed bone growth leading to osteoporosis, brain function is also effected with increasing risk of alzheimer's disease.  Menopause is the term used to describe the slowing of the important female hormonal system and can be experienced by women at any age, often these symptoms are not a result of being ""normal"" but an indication that something else is causing or interfering with normal hormone production.  The following are examples of some of the causes of menopause and estrogen deficiency:
<ul>
 	<li>Nutritional imbalances</li>
 	<li>Heavy metal toxicity</li>
 	<li>Bacteria</li>
 	<li>Virus</li>
 	<li>Poor diet</li>

<h3>The Histamine Test For Intolerance &amp; Allergy</h3>
The Histamine Intolerance &amp; Allergy Test is a simple blood test that determines the the amount of blood histamine you have.  This valuable test helps you to discover if you have imbalances of histamine.  Histamine is a powerful neurotransmitter which is involved in immune response and has influence over how your immune system responds.  Imbalances of histamine have been implicated in allergies, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, behavioural disorders and autism.
<h3>About The Histamine Intolerance &amp; Allergy Test</h3>
After you purchase the histamine test, you will receive a simple blood test kit in the mail.  The test kit comes with:
<ul>
 	<li>An authorized blood specimen order form that you take to your local accredited pathology for collection of your blood (<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/pathology-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Find a pathology near you here</strong></a>).</li>
 	<li>A blood specimen test kit for the pathology to use to collect your blood sample</li>
 	<li>Complete instructions for taking the test for you and the pathology</li>
</ul>
Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 7 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone.</strong>
<h3>Histamine Imbalances</h3>
Histamine is most well-known for its involvement in allergic reactions, however it also acts as a neurotransmitter like serotonin and dopamine. Histamine is involved in the wake-sleep cycle and is required for arousal, alertness, learning and memory. It also regulates appetite, other neurotransmitters, the perception of pain and some stress hormones.  Histamine imbalances, both low and high are known to be involved in mental health issues such as schizophrenia,  depression, anxiety, behavioral disorders and autism.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Low histamine levels are associated with</span> - depression, poor motivation, anxiety and issues with self-mutilation.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">High histamine levels are associated with</span> - schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, anorexia, bulimia, autism and depression.
<h3>Common Histamine Conditions</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Depression</li>
 	<li>Overweight</li>
 	<li>High pain threshold</li>
 	<li>Low libido &amp; difficult orgasm</li>
 	<li>Histadelia</li>
</ul>
<h3>About High or Excessive Histamine</h3>
Histamine Imbalance is an often overlooked problem, some people are actually genetically pre-programmed to produce more histamine which is a condition known as histadelia, this type of condition can make a person excessively compulsive and obsessive.  Having high histamine means that you are more likely to need higher levels of nutrients and a good nutrient dense diet, this is because high histamine type people are prone to using up nutrients at a fast rate making them prone to nutritional type diseases and depression quite easily.  Those with excessive or high histamine are likely to experience five or more of the following symptoms:
<ul>
 	<li>Headaches or migraines</li>
 	<li>Obsessive or compulsive tendencies</li>
 	<li>Seasonal allergies</li>
 	<li>Easy orgasm with sex</li>
 	<li>Light sleeper</li>
 	<li>Depression or suicidal thoughts</li>
 	<li>Inner tension or driven feeling</li>
 	<li>Excess body heat</li>
 	<li>Shy or over sensitive as a child</li>
 	<li>sneezing, crying or nauseated easily</li>
 	<li>Abnormal fears, compulsions or rituals</li>
 	<li>Have a fast metabolism</li>
 	<li>Have little  body hair and or thin build</li>
</ul>

<h3>The ALCAT Intolerance Test Platinum</h3>
<strong><a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/alcat/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">See all of the ALCAT Tests available here.</a></strong>

The ALCAT Intolerance Test Platinum is the most comprehensive personalised intolerance test available and was developed to measure personalised nutrition at the cellular level.  The core technology is a blood test that measures the body’s cellular response to challenges from a wide array of substances including various foods, additives, colouring, chemicals, functional foods and medicinal herbs.  This ALCAT test includes testing for the following intolerance's:
<ul>
 	<li>200 foods</li>
 	<li>20 food additives/chemicals</li>
 	<li>10 environmental chemicals</li>
 	<li>20 moulds</li>
 	<li>20 antibiotics/anti-inflammatories</li>
 	<li>50 general herbs</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the ALCAT Test?</h3>
The ALCAT test is a simple blood test that can be used to identify food and other factors that induce innate immune system activation. It measures changes in size and volume of white blood cells in response to ex vivo challenges with foods, chemicals and other environmental stimuli.  The ALCAT test is NOT an allergy or IgE test. The ALCAT is the most effective and comprehensive sensitivity/intolerance test available.

The advantage of the ALCAT involves the identification of specific foods that are triggering an inflammatory cascade. The identification of these specific foods works synergistically with the thesis that gut health is one of the primary and crucial organs responsible for chronic inflammatory states, whereby the etiology of the vast majority of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions can be traced back through a series of mechanisms to delayed food hypersensitivity via impaired intestinal permeability (so called ‘<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/intestinal-permeability-and-leaky-gut-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">leaky gut</a>’).

The ALCAT test method, which has been utilized successfully for over twenty years for food intolerance, also offers significant promise as an integrated functional assessment tool of specific micronutrient deficiencies.  A tremendous amount of health problems have been linked to food sensitivity and chronic inflammation – common everyday problems like migraines, aching joints, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, eczema, hyperactivity/ADD, asthma and even obesity.  It has been found that overweight subjects following an eating plan eliminating foods suspected of activating innate immunity, based on laboratory analysis of whole blood samples, experienced a significant improvement in body composition and scale weight.
<h3>About The ALCAT Intolerance Platinum Test</h3>
After you purchase the ALCAT Intolerance Platinum Test, you will receive a simple blood test kit in the mail.  The test kit comes with:
<ul>
 	<li>A blood spot test kit for you to provide your blood sample</li>
 	<li>Complete instructions for taking the test</li>
 	<li>Free express post return envelope to send back your sample</li>
</ul>
Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 7 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone.</strong>
<h3>How The ALCAT Test Works</h3>
The basic principle of The ALCAT test is measurement changes in white-cell diameter after exposure with foods, moulds, food additives, environmental chemicals, dyes and pharmacoactive agents.  The system has proved to be extremely reproducible and sensitive with amazing clinical outcomes.  Analysis of whole blood offers a significant advantage in that it contains all of the immune factors, cellular elements and serum proteins that might be involved in an adverse reaction of this type regardless of the underlying biological mechanism.

Once test results come back you have a clear picture of what your personal intolerance's are which gives you a clear road map of how to improve your health right from day one.  Below is an example of the food intolerance test, as you can see it clearly puts foods into categories showing different levels of intolerance's using color coded areas which indicates the severity of the intolerance:
<ul>
 	<li>Red - Severe Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Orange - Moderate Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Yellow - Mild Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Green - No intolerance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Intolerance, Sensitives and Inflammation</h3>
We know that inflammation of the gut impairs nutrient absorption and food allergy and intolerance is the major cause of inflamed gut syndromes. When inflammation develops as a result of an abnormal trigger and/or becomes chronic that normal tissues can be damaged.  Food intolerance provokes immune mediated vasculitis (inflammation), which causes fluid to leak from your capillaries into surrounding connective tissues and results in water retention.  For example, with ‘leaky gut’:
<ul>
 	<li>Increased permeability of stomach and intestinal lining causing large undigested food molecules to be released into blood stream.</li>
 	<li>Immune system sees food molecules as ‘foreign invader’ and mounts cellular response. Sends white cells to destroy undigested food proteins which are now lodged into vascular tissue.</li>
 	<li>Cells destroy not only food molecules but surrounding tissue as well.</li>
 	<li>This process is your body’s inflammatory response. The body is spending time neutralizing toxins, resulting in slowed metabolism.</li>
</ul>
Food sensitivity or intolerance may alter your biochemical balance, influencing appetite-controlling hormones like serotonin. This results in abnormal cravings for simple sugars and carbohydrates. Your metabolism is disrupted, resulting in less efficient energy production and increased fat storage.  Dietary lectins which may be resistant to degradation through cooking and digestion occur in numerous vegetables, fruits, grains and some meats. Some lectins can even bind to receptors on mast cells which trigger histamine release similar to that which is seen in classical allergic reactions. This lectin activity is not blood type specific. There is no convincing scientific evidence that blood type is associated with specific food induced pathologies.  Other immune conditions have been associated with food intolerance's.

The ALCAT Intolerance Test provides a major advantage in understanding what your body needs and doesn't need to heal itself, it provides a clear road map for anyone to follow to restore good health.

<strong>How The ALCAT Test Works</strong>

The basic principle of The ALCAT test measures changes in white-cell diameter after exposure with foods, moulds, food additives, environmental chemicals, dyes and pharmacoactive agents.  The system has proved to be extremely reproducible and sensitive with amazing clinical outcomes.  Analysis of whole blood offers a significant advantage as an antibody test in that it contains all of the immune factors, igg antibodies, antigen leukocyte, cellular elements and serum proteins that might be involved in an adverse reaction of this type regardless of the underlying biological mechanism.

Once test results come back you have a clear picture of what your personal intolerance’s are which gives you a clear road map of how to improve your health right from day one.  Below is an example of the food intolerance test, as you can see it clearly puts foods into categories showing different levels of intolerance’s using color coded areas which indicates the severity of the intolerance:
<ul>
 	<li>Red – Severe Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Orange – Moderate Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Yellow – Mild Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Green – No intolerance</li>
</ul>

<strong>Intolerance, Sensitives and Inflammation</strong>

We know that inflammation of the gut impairs nutrient absorption and food allergy and intolerance is the major cause of inflamed gut syndromes. When inflammation develops as a result of an abnormal trigger and/or becomes chronic that normal tissues can be damaged.  Food intolerance provokes immune mediated vasculitis (inflammation), which causes fluid to leak from your capillaries into surrounding connective tissues and results in water retention.  For example, with ‘leaky gut’:
<ul>
 	<li>Increased permeability of stomach and intestinal lining causing large undigested food molecules to be released into blood stream.</li>
 	<li>Immune system sees food molecules as ‘foreign invader’ and mounts cellular response. Sends white cells to destroy undigested food proteins which are now lodged into vascular tissue.</li>
 	<li>Cells destroy not only food molecules but surrounding tissue as well.</li>
 	<li>This process is your body’s inflammatory response. The body is spending time neutralizing toxins, resulting in slowed metabolism.</li>
</ul>
Food sensitivity or intolerance may alter your biochemical balance, influencing appetite-controlling hormones like serotonin. This results in abnormal cravings for simple sugars and carbohydrates. Your metabolism is disrupted, resulting in less efficient energy production and increased fat storage.  Dietary lectins which may be resistant to degradation through cooking and digestion occur in numerous vegetables, fruits, grains and some meats. Some lectins can even bind to receptors on mast cells which trigger histamine release similar to that which is seen in classical allergic reactions. This lectin activity is not blood type specific. There is no convincing scientific evidence that blood type is associated with specific food induced pathologies.  Other immune conditions have been associated with food intolerance’s.

<h3>The ALCAT Intolerance Test 100 Foods</h3>
<strong><a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/alcat/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">See all of the ALCAT Tests available here.</a></strong>

The ALCAT Intolerance Test is the most comprehensive personalised intolerance test available and was developed to measure personalised nutrition at the cellular level.  The core technology is a blood test that measures the body’s cellular response to challenges from a wide array of functional foods.  This ALCAT test includes testing for the following intolerance’s:
<ul>
 	<li>100 foods selected from 2 of the 4 cartridge list (for example select 2 x cartridge either from A, B, C or D – See Below)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the ALCAT Test?</h3>
The ALCAT test is a simple blood test that can be used to identify food and other factors that induce innate immune system activation. It measures changes in size and volume of white blood cells in response to ex vivo challenges with foods, chemicals and other environmental stimuli.  The ALCAT test is NOT an allergy or IgE test. The ALCAT is the most effective and comprehensive sensitivity/intolerance test available.

The advantage of the ALCAT involves the identification of specific foods that are triggering an inflammatory cascade. The identification of these specific foods works synergistically with the thesis that gut health is one of the primary and crucial organs responsible for chronic inflammatory states, whereby the etiology of the vast majority of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions can be traced back through a series of mechanisms to delayed food hypersensitivity via impaired intestinal permeability (so called ‘<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/intestinal-permeability-and-leaky-gut-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">leaky gut</a>’).

The ALCAT test method, which has been utilized successfully for over twenty years for food intolerance, also offers significant promise as an integrated functional assessment tool of specific micronutrient deficiencies.  A tremendous amount of health problems have been linked to food sensitivity and chronic inflammation – common everyday problems like migraines, aching joints, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, eczema, hyperactivity/ADD, asthma and even obesity.  It has been found that overweight subjects following an eating plan eliminating foods suspected of activating innate immunity, based on laboratory analysis of whole blood samples, experienced a significant improvement in body composition and scale weight.

<h3>Intolerance, Sensitives and Inflammation</h3>
We know that inflammation of the gut impairs nutrient absorption and food allergy and intolerance is the major cause of inflamed gut syndromes. When inflammation develops as a result of an abnormal trigger and/or becomes chronic that normal tissues can be damaged.  Food intolerance provokes immune mediated vasculitis (inflammation), which causes fluid to leak from your capillaries into surrounding connective tissues and results in water retention.  For example, with ‘leaky gut’:
<ul>
 	<li>Increased permeability of stomach and intestinal lining causing large undigested food molecules to be released into blood stream.</li>
 	<li>Immune system sees food molecules as ‘foreign invader’ and mounts cellular response. Sends white cells to destroy undigested food proteins which are now lodged into vascular tissue.</li>
 	<li>Cells destroy not only food molecules but surrounding tissue as well.</li>
 	<li>This process is your body’s inflammatory response. The body is spending time neutralizing toxins, resulting in slowed metabolism.</li>
</ul>
Food sensitivity or intolerance may alter your biochemical balance, influencing appetite-controlling hormones like serotonin. This results in abnormal cravings for simple sugars and carbohydrates. Your metabolism is disrupted, resulting in less efficient energy production and increased fat storage.  Dietary lectins which may be resistant to degradation through cooking and digestion occur in numerous vegetables, fruits, grains and some meats. Some lectins can even bind to receptors on mast cells which trigger histamine release similar to that which is seen in classical allergic reactions. This lectin activity is not blood type specific. There is no convincing scientific evidence that blood type is associated with specific food induced pathologies.  Other immune conditions have been associated with food intolerance’s.

The ALCAT Intolerance Test provides a major advantage in understanding what your body needs and doesn’t need to heal itself, it provides a clear road map for anyone to follow to restore good health.

<h3>The ALCAT Intolerance Test (Food Additives/Chemicals &amp; Environmental Chemicals &amp; Antibiotics/Anti-inflammatories)</h3>
<strong><a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/alcat/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">See all of the ALCAT Tests available here.</a></strong>

The ALCAT Intolerance Test is the most comprehensive personalised intolerance test available and was developed to measure personalised nutrition at the cellular level.  The core technology is a blood test that measures the body’s cellular response to challenges from a wide array of substances including various foods, additives, colouring, chemicals, functional foods and medicinal herbs.  This ALCAT test includes testing for the following intolerance’s:
<ul>
 	<li>20 food additives/chemicals</li>
 	<li>10 environmental chemicals</li>
 	<li>20 antibiotics &amp; inflammatories</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the ALCAT Test?</h3>
The ALCAT test is a simple blood test that can be used to identify food and other factors that induce innate immune system activation. It measures changes in size and volume of white blood cells in response to ex vivo challenges with foods, chemicals and other environmental stimuli.  The ALCAT test is NOT an allergy or IgE test. The ALCAT is the most effective and comprehensive sensitivity/intolerance test available.

The advantage of the ALCAT involves the identification of specific foods that are triggering an inflammatory cascade. The identification of these specific foods works synergistically with the thesis that gut health is one of the primary and crucial organs responsible for chronic inflammatory states, whereby the etiology of the vast majority of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions can be traced back through a series of mechanisms to delayed food hypersensitivity via impaired intestinal permeability (so called ‘<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/intestinal-permeability-and-leaky-gut-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">leaky gut</a>’).

The ALCAT test method, which has been utilized successfully for over twenty years for food intolerance, also offers significant promise as an integrated functional assessment tool of specific micronutrient deficiencies.  A tremendous amount of health problems have been linked to food sensitivity and chronic inflammation – common everyday problems like migraines, aching joints, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, eczema, hyperactivity/ADD, asthma and even obesity.  It has been found that overweight subjects following an eating plan eliminating foods suspected of activating innate immunity, based on laboratory analysis of whole blood samples, experienced a significant improvement in body composition and scale weight.
<h3>About The ALCAT Intolerance Test (Food Additives/Chemicals &amp; Environmental Chemicals &amp; Antibiotics/Anti-inflammatories)</h3>
After you purchase the ALCAT Intolerance Test, you will receive a simple blood test kit in the mail.  The test kit comes with:
<ul>
 	<li>A blood spot test kit for you to provide your blood sample</li>

</ul>
Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 7 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone.</strong>
<h3>How The ALCAT Test Works</h3>
The basic principle of The ALCAT test is measurement changes in white-cell diameter after exposure with foods, moulds, food additives, environmental chemicals, dyes and pharmacoactive agents.  The system has proved to be extremely reproducible and sensitive with amazing clinical outcomes.  Analysis of whole blood offers a significant advantage in that it contains all of the immune factors, cellular elements and serum proteins that might be involved in an adverse reaction of this type regardless of the underlying biological mechanism.

Once test results come back you have a clear picture of what your personal intolerance’s are which gives you a clear road map of how to improve your health right from day one.

<h3>Intolerance, Sensitives and Inflammation</h3>
We know that inflammation of the gut impairs nutrient absorption and food allergy and intolerance is the major cause of inflamed gut syndromes. When inflammation develops as a result of an abnormal trigger and/or becomes chronic that normal tissues can be damaged.  Food intolerance provokes immune mediated vasculitis (inflammation), which causes fluid to leak from your capillaries into surrounding connective tissues and results in water retention.  For example, with ‘leaky gut’:
<ul>
 	<li>Increased permeability of stomach and intestinal lining causing large undigested food molecules to be released into blood stream.</li>
 	<li>Immune system sees food molecules as ‘foreign invader’ and mounts cellular response. Sends white cells to destroy undigested food proteins which are now lodged into vascular tissue.</li>
 	<li>Cells destroy not only food molecules but surrounding tissue as well.</li>
 	<li>This process is your body’s inflammatory response. The body is spending time neutralizing toxins, resulting in slowed metabolism.</li>
</ul>
Food sensitivity or intolerance may alter your biochemical balance, influencing appetite-controlling hormones like serotonin. This results in abnormal cravings for simple sugars and carbohydrates. Your metabolism is disrupted, resulting in less efficient energy production and increased fat storage.  Dietary lectins which may be resistant to degradation through cooking and digestion occur in numerous vegetables, fruits, grains and some meats. Some lectins can even bind to receptors on mast cells which trigger histamine release similar to that which is seen in classical allergic reactions. This lectin activity is not blood type specific. There is no convincing scientific evidence that blood type is associated with specific food induced pathologies.  Other immune conditions have been associated with food intolerance’s.

The ALCAT Intolerance Test provides a major advantage in understanding what your body needs and doesn’t need to heal itself, it provides a clear road map for anyone to follow to restore good health.

<h3>The ALCAT Intolerance Test (Herbs Female)</h3>
<strong><a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/alcat/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">See all of the ALCAT Tests available here.</a></strong>

The ALCAT Intolerance Test is the most comprehensive personalised intolerance test available and was developed to measure personalised nutrition at the cellular level.  The core technology is a blood test that measures the body’s cellular response to challenges from a wide array of substances including various foods, additives, colouring, chemicals, functional foods and medicinal herbs.  This ALCAT test includes testing for the following intolerance’s:
<ul>
 	<li>50 functional foods used in dietary/herbal supplements for women</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the ALCAT Test?</h3>
The ALCAT test is a simple blood test that can be used to identify food and other factors that induce innate immune system activation. It measures changes in size and volume of white blood cells in response to ex vivo challenges with foods, chemicals and other environmental stimuli.  The ALCAT test is NOT an allergy or IgE test. The ALCAT is the most effective and comprehensive sensitivity/intolerance test available.

The advantage of the ALCAT involves the identification of specific foods that are triggering an inflammatory cascade. The identification of these specific foods works synergistically with the thesis that gut health is one of the primary and crucial organs responsible for chronic inflammatory states, whereby the etiology of the vast majority of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune conditions can be traced back through a series of mechanisms to delayed food hypersensitivity via impaired intestinal permeability (so called ‘<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/intestinal-permeability-and-leaky-gut-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">leaky gut</a>’).

The ALCAT test method, which has been utilized successfully for over twenty years for food intolerance, also offers significant promise as an integrated functional assessment tool of specific micronutrient deficiencies.  A tremendous amount of health problems have been linked to food sensitivity and chronic inflammation – common everyday problems like migraines, aching joints, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, eczema, hyperactivity/ADD, asthma and even obesity.  It has been found that overweight subjects following an eating plan eliminating foods suspected of activating innate immunity, based on laboratory analysis of whole blood samples, experienced a significant improvement in body composition and scale weight.
<h3>About The ALCAT Intolerance Test (Herbs Female)</h3>
After you purchase the ALCAT Intolerance Platinum Test, you will receive a simple blood test kit in the mail.  The test kit comes with:
<ul>
 	<li>A blood spot test kit for you to provide your blood sample</li>
 	<li>Complete instructions for taking the test</li>
 	<li>Free express post return envelope to send back your sample.</li>

<h3>How The ALCAT Test Works</h3>
The basic principle of The ALCAT test is measurement changes in white-cell diameter after exposure with foods, moulds, food additives, environmental chemicals, dyes and pharmacoactive agents.  The system has proved to be extremely reproducible and sensitive with amazing clinical outcomes.  Analysis of whole blood offers a significant advantage in that it contains all of the immune factors, cellular elements and serum proteins that might be involved in an adverse reaction of this type regardless of the underlying biological mechanism.

Once test results come back you have a clear picture of what your personal intolerance’s are which gives you a clear road map of how to improve your health right from day one.  Below is an example of the food intolerance test, as you can see it clearly puts foods into categories showing different levels of intolerance’s using color coded areas which indicates the severity of the intolerance:
<ul>
 	<li>Red – Severe Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Orange – Moderate Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Yellow – Mild Intolerance</li>
 	<li>Green – No intolerance</li>

<h3>The Adrenal Fatigue Saliva Test (Extensive)</h3>
<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/hormone-testing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">See all of the hormone tests available here.</a>

Do you suffer from stress?  Don’t know why you’re tired and fatigued most of the time?  It may be an adrenal fatigue problem….

Adrenal fatigue is a condition that can result from imbalances in one or two important hormones, DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) and Cortisol that are responsible for controlling how you respond to stress.  When one or both of these hormones becomes depleted that’s when fatigue or adrenal insufficiency can result.

The adrenal fatigue saliva test is the most accurate and powerful non invasive hormone test that helps you to discover the true levels of these important hormones and be able to take actions to resolve adrenal fatigue helping to reduce stress and resolve many other associated problems.

<strong>The test focuses on checking the levels of both DHEA,  Cortisol and Secretory IgA (<span class=""_Tgc"">Immunoglobulin A</span>) to determine irregularities.</strong>  The adrenal fatigue test uses your saliva to measure these important hormones which are laboratory verified and results are then checked by one of our professional health practitioners who provides the results and guidance on what to do with the results.
<h3>Do you have any of the signs of adrenal fatigue?</h3>
Adrenal fatigue can cause many different symptoms in your body and in many cases can cause serious harm if left unchecked.  It’s important to check your adrenals if you have any of the following common symptoms:
<ul>
 	<li>Anxiety</li>
 	<li>Fibromyalgia</li>
 	<li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
 	<li>Headaches</li>
 	<li>Hypoglycemia</li>
 	<li>Hypotension</li>
 	<li>Poor concentration, ‘brain fog’</li>
 	<li>Energy levels</li>
 	<li>Fatigue, lethargy, consistent tiredness</li>
 	<li>Salt cravings</li>
 	<li>Depression</li>
 	<li>Lack of stamina</li>
 	<li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
 	<li>Irregular sleeping patterns</li>
 	<li>Thyroid dysfunction</li>
 	<li>Blood pressure problems</li>
 	<li>Depression</li>
 	<li>Impaired Immune System</li>
 	<li>Insomnia</li>
</ul>
<h3>About adrenal function, stress, adrenal problems and testing</h3>
The adrenal glans which are both located on top of your kidney’s belong to the hormonal system or endocrine system.  Adrenal fatigue is a very common condition in today’s society through the physical and physiological demands we put on our adrenal glands. Each gland is composed of two distinct zones, the large outer cortex and the inner medulla.

The adrenal glans use two important hormones to help you control stress, these include DHEA and Cortisol which are used to maintain a healthy balance of stress response.  Therefore the adrenal fatigue test is considered a “stress test”, this is because when a person experiences above average levels of stress the balances of these hormones can tell us if a person is in or at risk of fatigue or “burn out”.  Understanding the true balances of these two hormones helps us to make educated decisions about how to restore good health and in many cases prevent more serious health problems.

In the case of adrenal fatigue or adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands run low of the balancing hormones and a loss of vital energy or “burn out” is experienced, often this condition cannot be resolved without first knowing the levels of DHEA and cortisol so that appropriate action can be taken to restore healthy function.  This test can also be helpful in the discovery of other underlying health problems that may need attention.

Testing the hormones produced by the adrenal glands serves as a critical tool for uncovering biochemical imbalances underlying many of the above mentioned symptoms.

Many of the adrenal function problems of today are related to a stressful lifestyle, nutritional problems/imbalances, environmental toxicity and poor diet.
<h3>The adrenal function saliva test process</h3>
The adrenal fatigue test can be done right from your home or work place, the test kit contains a full set of instructions and all equipment required to provide your sample for testing.

This simple test only takes minutes to complete, this is done by taking 4 saliva samples over a 12 hour period, then your samples are placed in the provided return express postage bag which is sent to the laboratory for testing.

Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 7 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone.</strong>

<strong>For Australian Orders</strong> we provide an express postage reply-paid envelope with your Adrenal Fatigue test kit for you to send your test sample directly to our pathology laboratory in Australia.

<h3>The Female Menstrual Cycle Hormone Saliva Test (28 day)</h3>
<strong><a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/hormone-testing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">See all of the hormone tests available here.</a></strong>

Many women experience symptoms related to their menstrual cycle.  Assessing progesterone and estradiol levels throughout a 28 day cycle can help ascertain whether a deficiency or excess of these hormones are present in the three phases of the menstrual cycle (follicular, ovulatory and luteal phases).
<h3>About The 28 Day Menstrual Cycle Hormone Test</h3>
The test is a simple saliva test that only takes a few minutes every few days over 28 days, the test can be done right from your home or office and is then sent back to the laboratory in the provided express post bag. The female hormone imbalance test is measuring your balances of the hormones estrogen Estradiol (E2), (P4) progesterone, and testosterone over a 28 day period of a female’s regular menstrual cycle. The female hormone imbalance test is simple, it provides a thorough analysis of estradiol and progesterone over a full 28 day cycle, you will receive a saliva test kit in the mail. The test kit comes with:
<ul>
 	<li>All the equipment needed to complete the test</li>
 	<li>A full set of instructions</li>
 	<li>Express Post bag for overnight return delivery to the laboratory</li>
 	<li>Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 5 - 7 business days for evaluation. <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone so you’ll know exactly what you need to do if the results come back positive.</strong></li>

<h3>Symptoms Of Female Menstrual Cycle Imbalances</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Amenorrhea</li>
 	<li>Menopause</li>
 	<li>Dysmenorrhea</li>
 	<li>Premenstrual Syndrome</li>
 	<li>Infertility</li>
 	<li>Irregular periods</li>
 	<li>Polycystic ovaries</li>
 	<li>Endometriosis</li>
</ul>
Hormone imbalances reveal the rhythm of hormones and their fluctuations which can help identify the key causes of disorders such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), infertility, and menstrual irregularities.  Hormonal balance is the key to optimal health. Research has long shown that fluctuating levels of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone play a major role in a woman´ s overall health affecting a variety of conditions including menstrual cycles, sleep patterns, menopause, infertility PCOS, PMS, breast cancer and endometriosis.
<h3>The Importance of Having Balanced Female Hormones</h3>
Female hormones are crucial to a woman’s reproductive health. The main hormones affecting the menstrual cycle and fertility are produced by glands in the brain and by the ovaries. Those hormones regulate menstruation, fertility and sex drive, any one of which can be adversely affected if the production of these hormones goes out of balance, further hormonal changes gradually cause reproductive organs to shut down eventually leading to menopause and female hormone imbalance symptoms.  Apart from those important points, female hormones also help to maintain good health and have anti-aging properties.  Despite popular belief menopause and menopause symptoms can also be reversed.
<h3>Estrogen Deficiency, Osteoporosis and Menopause</h3>
In addition to the symptoms listed above, osteoporosis and memory loss are also common problems associated with menopause or the loss of vital hormone production, as estrogen hormones decrease in the case of estrogen deficiency other factors come into play such as slowed bone growth leading to osteoporosis, brain function is also effected with increasing risk of alzheimer’s disease.  Menopause is the term used to describe the slowing of the important female hormonal system and can be experienced by women at any age, often these symptoms are not a result of being “normal” but an indication that something else is causing or interfering with normal hormone production.  The following are examples of some of the causes of menopause and estrogen deficiency:
<ul>
 	<li>Nutritional imbalances</li>
 	<li>Heavy metal toxicity</li>
 	<li>Bacteria</li>
 	<li>Virus</li>
 	<li>Poor diet</li>

<h3>The Importance of Having Balanced Female Hormones</h3>
Female hormones are crucial to a woman’s reproductive health. The main hormones affecting the menstrual cycle and fertility are produced by glands in the brain and by the ovaries. Those hormones regulate menstruation, fertility and sex drive, any one of which can be adversely affected if the production of these hormones goes out of balance, further hormonal changes gradually cause reproductive organs to shut down eventually leading to menopause and female hormone imbalance symptoms.  Apart from those important points, female hormones also help to maintain good health and have anti-aging properties.  Despite popular belief menopause and menopause symptoms can also be reversed.
<h3>Estrogen Deficiency, Osteoporosis and Menopause</h3>
In addition to the symptoms listed above, osteoporosis and memory loss are also common problems associated with menopause or the loss of vital hormone production, as estrogen hormones decrease in the case of estrogen deficiency other factors come into play such as slowed bone growth leading to osteoporosis, brain function is also effected with increasing risk of alzheimer’s disease.  Menopause is the term used to describe the slowing of the important female hormonal system and can be experienced by women at any age, often these symptoms are not a result of being “normal” but an indication that something else is causing or interfering with normal hormone production.  The following are examples of some of the causes of menopause and estrogen deficiency:
<ul>
 	<li>Nutritional imbalances</li>
 	<li>Heavy metal toxicity</li>
 	<li>Bacteria</li>
 	<li>Virus</li>
 	<li>Poor diet</li>

The role of B vitamins is complex, they often work together to achieve optimal health so it's important to understand that if you are deficient in just one of the B vitamins then other B vitamins can't do their job properly and individual B vitamins are often relied upon by other varied vitamins and minerals.  Deficiencies of B vitamins can occur for many different reasons, here are some basic facts for each of the B vitamins that are included in this test:

<strong>Vitamin B1:</strong> Essential for energy production, brain function and digestion.  B1 also helps the body make use of proteins such as <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/amino-acid-analysis-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">amino acids</a>.  B1 needed to produce cellular energy from the foods you eat, and is also required for the synthesis of DNA and RNA.

<strong>Vitamin B2</strong>: Helps turn fats, sugars and proteins into energy.  B2 is needed to repair and maintain healthy skin inside and outside.  It helps to regulate body acidity.  B2 is also important for nail, hair and eyes.  Is a basic building block for normal growth and development. It is needed for healthy cellular energy production and also supports the antioxidant activity in the body.

<strong>Vitamin B6:</strong> Essential  for protein digestion and utilization, brain function and hormone production.  B6 helps balance sex hormones such as <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/hormone-imbalance-test-female/"">estrogen</a> and <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/hormone-imbalance-test-male/"">testosterone</a>.  B6 Is involved in over 100 cellular reactions throughout the body, vitamin B6 is instrumental in keeping various bodily functions operating at their best.  B6 is a natural anti-depressant and diuretic and helps control allergic reactions.

<strong>Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid)</strong>: Is critical during pregnancy for development of the brain and nerves.  B9 is always essential for brain and nerve function, is needed for utilising protein and in red blood cell formation.  B9 is needed for DNA synthesis, the formation of red blood cells and for the metabolism of <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/amino-acid-analysis-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">amino acids</a>.

<strong>Vitamin B12</strong>: Needed for making use of proteins, it helps the blood carry oxygen.  B12 is essential for nerves and is also needed to deal with tobacco smoke and other toxins.  B12 Plays a critical role in the pathways of the body that produce cellular energy. It is also needed for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation and for healthy nervous system function.

<h3>About Amino Acids</h3>
Amino acids play central roles both as building blocks of proteins and as intermediates in metabolism.  They are catalysts to most, if not all, cellular processes. Scientific research has demonstrated that conditions as varied as chemical sensitivities, cardiovascular disease, macular degeneration, bone disorders and insomnia are associated with amino acid imbalances.  Amino acids are required for neurotransmitter and hormone production.

Numerous health conditions are associated with amino acid metabolism as a result of the many physiological processes they are involved in.  The production of neurotransmitters, hormones, nitric oxide, urea, antioxidants, connective tissue and ATP are just a few examples.  Liver detoxification reactions involve glutathione conjugation, amino acid conjugation (taurine, glycine) methylation, sulphation and acetylation and glucuronidation.
<h3>Symptoms of Amino Acid Deficiency or Excess</h3>
Many people have amino deficiencies and or excesses this is because each person is unique and has different amino acid requirements.  There are many problems that can result in amino acid imbalances some of these include:

ADD

ADHD

Allergies

Ammonia Toxicity

Anxiety

Autism

Birth defects

Body building under-performance

Cardiovascular disease

Chemical intolerances

Dermatitis

Fatigue

Gastrointestinal disorders

Headaches

Hyperactivity

Hypertension

Hypotonia

Inflammatory disorders

Insomnia

Malnutrition

Mental health issues

<strong> About Coenzyme Q10 And Supplements
</strong>

Coenzyme Q10plays a central role in energy metabolism, it improves heart function helping to normalise blood pressure and improves other bodily functions.  Coenzyme Q10 can help prevent heart disease so knowing your true levels with this test is important especially as you age, this is because Coenzyme Q10 naturally declines as you age so regular checks of your enzyme levels is highly recommended.   Coenzyme Q10  has the ability to increase exercise tolerance, is a powerful antioxidant and also boosts immunity. Coenzyme Q10 can become depleted in the body by the consumption of stimulants and sugar. Coenzyme Q10 supplements are only beneficial for those that have a deficiency in the enzyme, taking supplements without knowing your true levels of Coenzyme Q10 can throw out your body's nutritional balance.

<h3>About Copper</h3>
Copper is both an essential element and a toxic one.  Owing to the widespread use of copper in our water pipes plus other exposures to copper more people are toxic to copper than deficient in copper.  Copper toxicity can also come from the use of the contraceptive pill, IUDs and fertility hormones.  The biggest problem with copper toxicity is that high levels of copper antagonize zinc which can leave you <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/zinc-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">zinc deficient</a>.  High levels of copper may also be a factor in post-natal depression and or mental illness, especially anxiety, paranoia, and schizophrenia.  Extreme fears and hallucinations are also related to copper excess.

Copper is important in the human body for good health however only in very low amounts compared to zinc which is often deficient in people with copper excess, therefore the reason a person can have copper toxicity can be as a result of having a zinc deficiency so its important to <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/zinc-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">check your zinc levels</a> at the same time as checking your copper levels.

<div class=""spqc-a"" dir=""auto"" title=""symptoms of zinc deficiency""></div>
<div class=""spqc-a"" dir=""auto"" title=""symptoms of zinc deficiency"">Zinc deficiency is a common problem with many people having the deficiency without knowing it which can lead to disease. While zinc deficiency can be cause through poor diet there are many other factors that can disrupt this imporant mineral, foods such as wheat which contain phytates, rhubarb, spinach, chocolate and tea which contain oxalates rob are considered robbers of zinc.  High calcium intake (including supplements), low protein intake or <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/amino-acid-analysis-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">amino acid deficiency</a>, excess sugar intake, stress and alcohol all contribute to the loss of zinc.</div>

<p>Severe iodine deficiency is a significant public health issue, particularly in Australia, where its prevalence has more than quadrupled over the last two decades. This deficiency can lead to serious health consequences, including hypothyroidism and developmental issues in children, especially during pregnancy. To prevent iodine deficiency, it is crucial to include iodine-rich foods in your diet, such as fish, seafood, dairy, and seaweed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":2} -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Iodine is a vital mineral that plays a crucial role in maintaining thyroid function, growth, and development. It is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism, energy production, and overall health. Despite its importance, iodine deficiency is a widespread health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. In this article, we will discuss the importance of iodine, the benefits of taking the iodine test, and how to interpret the results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What is Iodine?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Iodine is a naturally occurring mineral found in various foods, including seafood, dairy products, and iodised table salt. It is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), which regulate metabolism, growth, and development. Since the body does not produce iodine, it must be obtained through diet or supplements to ensure proper thyroid function and overall health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Importance of Iodine</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Iodine is crucial for maintaining thyroid function, which is essential for overall health. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, energy production, and growth, and play a critical role in the development of the brain and nervous system. Iodine deficiency can lead to a range of health problems, including hypothyroidism, weight gain, and impaired cognitive function. Ensuring adequate iodine intake is vital for preventing these issues and supporting the body’s metabolic processes.</p>

<h3>Have you checked your iodine levels?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The iodine deficiency urine test is a simple test you can do right from your home or office. The test involves collecting a urine sample for analysis, which only takes a minute and provides an accurate account of your iodine levels. It measures your body’s iodine levels, helping you determine if your iodine is balanced or if you have an iodine deficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Why Take the Iodine Test?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The iodine test is a simple and effective way to determine iodine levels in the body. It is especially important for individuals who are at risk of iodine deficiency, including pregnant women, smokers, and those with vegan or vegetarian diets. By identifying iodine deficiency early, the test allows for prompt treatment and prevention of related health problems. Taking the iodine test can help ensure that your body has the necessary iodine to maintain healthy thyroid function and overall well-being.</p>

<h3>The Iodine Test</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The iodine test is a simple urine test that can be done right from your home or office. Another method for assessing iodine levels is the iodine loading test, which is effective in detecting both mild and severe deficiencies. Testing for iodine imbalances is really important due to its ability to prevent many common health problems including <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/thyroid-hormone-tsh-test"" target=""_blank"">thyroid hormone problems</a>.

<h3>Symptoms Of Iodine Deficiency </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being iodine deficient can lead to various health problems, most of which are a result of thyroid dysfunction because the thyroid needs iodine to function correctly. Some of the symptoms of iodine deficiency resulting in thyroid dysfunction, such as hypothyroidism, include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li><p>Weight gain</p></li><li><p>Physical or mental fatigue or lethargy</p></li><li><p>Depression or irritability</p></li><li><p>Dry skin and or hair</p></li><li><p>Muscle pain</p></li><li><p>Painful periods</p></li><li><p>Intolerance to cold or cold hands and feet</p></li><li><p>Constipation, gas, bloating or indigestion</p></li><li><p>Sore throat or nasal congestion</p></li><li><p>Poor memory</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Thyroid Problems</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thyroid abnormalities are one of the most common endocrine disorders affecting millions worldwide. The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in hormone production, and its function is significantly impacted by iodine levels in the body. <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/thyroid-hormone-tsh-test"" target=""_blank"">Thyroid hormones</a> are well known for their role in basal metabolic rate, development and growth. Therefore, it is understandable that abnormalities in the level of thyroid hormones can lead to a diverse array of symptoms involving the heart, brain, skin and reproductive systems. Chronic stress can deplete thyroid function as the stress hormone <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""http://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/cortisol-test"" target=""_blank"">cortisol</a> inhibits thyroid function. Autoimmune disease of the thyroid can cause both hypo and hyperthyroidism, as the antibodies can either block or stimulate the thyroid receptors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Iodine Deficiency &amp; Pregnancy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An iodine deficiency during pregnancy can result in birth defects, lowered IQ, mental retardation and stunted growth. High blood pressure is also a potential risk associated with iodine deficiency during pregnancy. Iodine may also play a role in the maintenance of healthy breast tissue. The World Health Organization has also related iodine deficiency to infertility. Iodine is most important for women, because it is most highly concentrated in the thyroid, breasts and ovaries. Iodine deficiency can lead to menstrual irregularities, infertility, early menopause, and ovarian diseases.</p>

<h3 class=""spqc-a"" dir=""auto"" title=""symptoms of zinc deficiency""><span class=""spqc-e spqc-h"">About Pfeiffer</span></h3>
Dr Carl Pfeiffer is a well recognized scientist who made may discoveries about the influence of certain nutrients on each individuals.  His main work help discover that many mental illnesses could be traced back to nutritional imbalances and that each person was unique in their need for certain nutrients in order to prevent mental disorders.  Dr Pheiffer found that while some peoples mental problems improved greatly through certain nutritional intervention other patients actually got worse from the same treatment for the same conditions, this meant that each person was unique and so treating each patient using the pheiffer test would provide a much better insight into the cause and treatment for a patient.

Dr Pfeiffer was also responsible for his findings in the disorders such as <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/kryptopyrrole-pyroluria-pyrrole-mauve-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kryptopyrrole, Mauve Factor, Pyroluria and or Pyrrole</a>.  Dr Pfeiffer also studied the influence of <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">homocystenine</a> and <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/histamine-intolerance-allergy-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">histamine</a> in relation to mental health disorders that resulted in good outcomes for patients.
<h3>Mental health Disorders</h3>
Using the pfeiffer test can greatly improve mental health disorders such as ADD (attention deficit disorder), ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), schizophrenia, Autism, learning disorders and mental disorders, this is because many of the nutritional pathways tested in the pfeiffer test have a major effect on <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/neurotransmitter-test-extensive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">neurotransmitters</a> that control how we think, how we feel and how we behave.  Just one imbalance has the potential to cause a major mental health disorder that could otherwise be treated, the pfeiffer test is a test that offers a complete evaluation of one’s overall biochemical function that can impact a patient’s mental and physical well-being.

<h3>About HCG</h3>
HCG is an important hormone especially during pregnancy, this is because HCG is a growth hormone used to help grow a fetus.  Low levels of HCG of HCG deficiency in women can cause infertility and in many cases can cause miscarriage and underdevelopment of the fetus.  The reason HCG levels are so important is because of it's role in promoting the process of pregnancy, HCG does this by promoting the luteinizing hormone that triggers ovulation which won't happen if HCG is too low and or other <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/hormone-imbalance-test-female/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">female hormones are out of balance</a>.

Excessive amounts of HCG can be used to indicate the presence of some cancers, the HCG test can show abnormally high levels which could indicate tumor markers.
<h3>HCG and Weight Loss</h3>
Scientific research has shown that HCG helps in the promotion of weight loss.  HCG does this by stimulating the hypothalamus which is responsible many metabolic processes some of which control hunger, body temperature, fatigue, sleep and cardiovascular rhythms.

<h3>How The Allergy Test Works</h3>
The IgA food allergy test is measuring the antibodies that your immune system produces in response to the allergy food list below.  IgA antibodies are one of the most important antibodies as it is the body's first line of defense so it can tell you which foods you are reacting to and which ones you aren't.  Testing for IgA antibodies against specific foods may be raised when the lining of the intestinal tract, the mucous membrane, become inflamed or damaged. Elevated IgA to specific foods can be a sign of damage to the mucous membranes in the gut.

Individuals with Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/coeliac-and-gluten-intolerance-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">coeliac and gluten intolerance</a> or even those with suspected <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/intestinal-permeability-and-leaky-gut-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">leaky gut</a> may benefit from testing IgA food reactions.

 	<li>Sinus Problems</li>
 	<li>Reactions to foods and substances</li>
</ul>
<h2>Allergies Vs Intolerance's &amp; Sensitivities</h2>
Some people have allergies to certain foods, this means that when they consume a specific food that they are allergic to, their body's immune system responds by attacking the substance in order to protect them from the substance.  Allergies are always related to an immune system response.  On the other hand many people have food intolerance's, this means that when they consume a food that ""disagrees"" with them they experience symptoms that often seem like an allergy however the immune system isn't involved which is difference between an allergy and an intolerance.

Food intolerance's or food sensitivity's are your body's way of saying, ""I can't digest that"" or ""That food is irritating"" or ""That food in not compatible with me"".  If you believe that you may have a food intolerance you may benefit from a <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/food-compatibility-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">food compatibility program</a> or <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/alcat-intolerance-test-200-foods/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">food intolerance and sensitivity testing</a>.

The IgA food allergy test is measuring the antibodies that your immune system produces in response to the allergy food list below.  IgA antibodies are one of the most important antibodies as it is the body's first line of defense so it can tell you which foods you are reacting to and which ones you aren't.  Testing for IgA antibodies against specific foods may be raised when the lining of the intestinal tract, the mucous membrane, become inflamed or damaged. Elevated IgA to specific foods can be a sign of damage to the mucous membranes in the gut.

<h2>Allergies Vs Intolerance's &amp; Sensitivities</h2>
Some people have allergies to certain foods, this means that when they consume a specific food that they are allergic to, their body's immune system responds by attacking the substance in order to protect them from the substance.  Allergies are always related to an immune system response.  On the other hand many people have food intolerance's, this means that when they consume a food that ""disagrees"" with them they experience symptoms that often seem like an allergy however the immune system isn't involved which is difference between an allergy and an intolerance.

Food intolerance's or food sensitivity's are your body's way of saying, ""I can't digest that"" or ""That food is irritating"" or ""That food in not compatible with me"".  If you believe that you may have a food intolerance you may benefit from a <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/food-compatibility-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">food compatibility program</a> or <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/alcat-intolerance-test-200-foods/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">food intolerance and sensitivity testing</a>.

<h3>How The Allergy Test Works</h3>
The IgE food allergy test is measuring the IgE antibodies primarily found in the mucous secretions, this test is ideal for food allergy reactions that occur about immediately after exposure to the food allergen such as within a few minutes to a few hours.  The IgE allergy test is regarded as a Type 1 immediate hypersensitivity reaction, the antibodies of IgE have an immediate reaction which are caused by an allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody that floats around in the blood stream.

IgE food allergies cause your immune system to react abnormally when exposed to one or more specific foods. Some of the common foods that people have an IgE reaction to are things like nuts, milk and eggs. The IgE allergy test picks up on IgE reactions to foods on the below list which are then considered allergens.  It is recommended that IgE allergy testing is only performed for infants greater than 18 months of age.
<h3>Which Foods Are Tested</h3>
In this allergy test there are 27 common western allergen foods that are tested these include:

<h3>How The Allergy Test Works</h3>
The IgG inhalant allergy test offers a useful tool for detecting the inhalants causing delayed allergic responses to inhalants. The IgG inhalants allergy test is measuring the IgG antibodies primarily found circulating in all bodily fluids, this test is ideal for airborne allergy reactions that don't occur immediately.   IgG antibodies are very important in fighting bacterial and viral infections. IgG antibodies are the only type of antibody that can cross the placenta in a pregnant woman to help protect her baby (fetus).  This test allows you to identify possible allergens as per the allergen list below.

The IgG test will not identify acute immediate food allergies, that occur about or immediately after exposure to the food allergens such as within a few minutes to a few hours, if you have immediate reactions see the <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/allergy-test-inhalants-64-allergens/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IgE inhalants test instead</a>.

It is recommended that IgG inhalant allergy testing is only performed for infants greater than 18 months of age.

<h2>Allergies Vs Intolerance’s &amp; Sensitivities</h2>
Some people have allergies to certain foods, this means that when they consume a specific food that they are allergic to, their body’s immune system responds by attacking the substance in order to protect them from the substance.  Allergies are always related to an immune system response.  On the other hand many people have food intolerance’s, this means that when they consume a food that “disagrees” with them they experience symptoms that often seem like an allergy however the immune system isn’t involved which is difference between an allergy and an intolerance.

Food intolerance’s or food sensitivity’s are your body’s way of saying, “I can’t digest that” or “That food is irritating” or “That food in not compatible with me”.  If you believe that you may have a food intolerance you may benefit from a <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/food-compatibility-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">food compatibility program</a> or <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/alcat-intolerance-test-200-foods/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">food intolerance and sensitivity testing</a>.

<h3 class=""spqc-a"" dir=""auto"" title=""symptoms of zinc deficiency""><span class=""spqc-e spqc-h"">About Pfeiffer</span></h3>
Dr Carl Pfeiffer is a well recognized scientist who made may discoveries about the influence of certain nutrients on each individuals.  His main work help discover that many mental illnesses could be traced back to nutritional imbalances and that each person was unique in their need for certain nutrients in order to prevent mental disorders.  Dr Pheiffer found that while some peoples mental problems improved greatly through certain nutritional intervention other patients actually got worse from the same treatment for the same conditions, this meant that each person was unique and so treating each patient using the pheiffer test would provide a much better insight into the cause and treatment for a patient.

Dr Pfeiffer was also responsible for his findings in the disorders such as <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/kryptopyrrole-pyroluria-pyrrole-mauve-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kryptopyrrole, Mauve Factor, Pyroluria and or Pyrrole</a>.  Dr Pfeiffer also studied the influence of <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">homocystenine</a> and <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/histamine-intolerance-allergy-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">histamine</a> in relation to mental health disorders that resulted in good outcomes for patients.
<h3>Mental health Disorders</h3>
Using the pfeiffer test can greatly improve mental health disorders such as ADD (attention deficit disorder), ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), schizophrenia, Autism, learning disorders and mental disorders, this is because many of the nutritional pathways tested in the pfeiffer test have a major effect on <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/404/404product/neurotransmitter-test-extensive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">neurotransmitters</a> that control how we think, how we feel and how we behave.  Just one imbalance has the potential to cause a major mental health disorder that could otherwise be treated, the pfeiffer test is a test that offers a complete evaluation of one’s overall biochemical function that can impact a patient’s mental and physical well-being.

Organic acids play a very important part in how our body works and is responsible many of the metabolic (metabolism) processes that keep you healthy, when one or more of these organic acids becomes out of balance they can cause havoc with your health both physically and mentally.  Testing for organic acids imbalances with the environmental pollutants test is a great way to get an overview of how toxic you are to some of the largest environmental and workplace pollutants found everywhere in modern day living.
<h3>The Organic Acids Environmental Pollutants Test</h3>
The environmental pollutants test is a simple urine test that can be done right from you home or office.  The test evaluates the levels of several toxic substances found common in our environment, home and  workplace.  The test includes:
<ul>
 	<li>The test kit</li>
 	<li>The test kit full instructions</li>
 	<li>Express post overnight return delivery to laboratory</li>
 	<li>Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 12 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone so you’ll know exactly what you need to do if the results come back positive.</strong></li>

<h3><span class=""_Tgc"">Common Symptoms of Environmental Pollutants Imbalances
</span></h3>
<p class=""row "">Metabolic disorders involving environmental pollutants can vary greatly, this is because the environmental pollutants can interfere with the normal metabolic processes that keep us healthy and these pollutants can also cause severe disease leading to death,  here are some of the more common symptoms associated with environmental pollutants:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Allergies</li>
 	<li>Sinus congestion</li>
 	<li>Thyroid dysfunction</li>
 	<li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
 	<li>Fibromyalgia</li>
 	<li>Neurological conditions</li>
 	<li>Impaired immune system</li>
 	<li>Female fertility issues</li>
 	<li>Endocrine related cancers</li>
 	<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
</ul>
<h3>About The Organic Acids <span class=""_Tgc"">Environmental Pollutants</span> Test</h3>
The organic acid environmental pollutant test is a significant test when it comes to toxicity, it is evident that increasing exposure to environmental pollutants has been linked to many chronic diseases such as autism spectrum disorders, autoimmune disorders, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Usually, many different individual tests are necessary to determine each pollutant. However, the environmental pollutant test makes it possible in one single test to measure the degree of toxicity to pollutants in the environment, whether it be in the air, what we consume or what we are exposed to. This unique test measures the environmental pollutants which assesses exposure the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Benzene</li>
 	<li>Xylene</li>
 	<li>Toluene</li>
 	<li>Trimethylbenzene</li>
 	<li>Styrene</li>
 	<li>Phthalate</li>
</ul>
Many of these toxic substances are commonly found in the air, our water supply and in the food we eat, toxic levels can build up in the body causing many different types of illnesses and disease, taking this test helps discover toxic levels so a specific detoxification treatment can be provided.

<h3>About Cardiovascular Disease</h3>
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, fortunately, over the past thirty years significant progress has been made in the areas of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  The conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease include hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and low HDL cholesterol.

However, in an individual the presence of only one of these factors has a low positive predictive value leaving out important warning signs. Furthermore, a significant number of cardiovascular events still occur in individuals without these established risk indicators.

At present, the most advanced strategy for coronary risk assessment is therefore to combine the information of several risk factors. This multi-marker approach can enhance risk assessment, identifying those individuals with a moderate baseline risk who might benefit from reduction strategies. Not only are conventional risk factors assessed, but other CVD biomarkers such as lipoprotein (a), apolipoproteins A &amp; B, <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">homocysteine</a>, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP) are included in this life saving test.

Knowing these valuable indicators of cardiovascular disease potential can be an extremely useful in <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/nutritional-balance-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">discovering nutritional imbalances</a> that can often prevent and or correct a cardiovascular failure.
<h3>Common Cardiovascular Conditions</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Hypercholesterolemia</li>
 	<li>Insulin resistance</li>
 	<li>Diabetes</li>
 	<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
 	<li>Statin drug therapy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Are you using statin drugs to cover up the problem?</h3>
<span class=""_Tgc"">Statins are a class of drugs often prescribed by doctors to help lower cholesterol levels in the blood. By lowering the levels, they help prevent heart attacks and stroke. Studies show that, in certain people,  they reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and even death from heart disease.  The problem is, as with many medications, statin drugs are doing the job that should normally be done by the body while leaving the underlying problem unchecked and producing side effects that can lead to other complications.  Taking the cardiovascular test is valuable in being able to discover underlying imbalances that can be treated naturally and in many causes those dependent on statin drugs are able to taper off these medications with the supervision of their medical doctor.

<h3>About the Omega 3’s and Cardio Vascular Disease</h3>
Omega‐3 fatty acids are essential to the human body and have benefits for our heart, brain, eyes and joints. By reducing inflammation, blood clots and improving membrane function, omega‐3 fats are associated with a<strong> lower risk of heart complications</strong> <strong>– including heart disease</strong>, plaque build‐up and heart attacks, both in persons with a history of heart disease and in healthy individuals. Omega‐3 fats are important for optimal brain development in babies and mental function, particularly later in life.  <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/essential-fatty-acids-test-omega-3-6-9-epa-dha/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Testing the balance of your omega fats</a> can also help in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

<h3>More about hair mineral analysis</h3>
Hair can contain minerals and metals that can accumulate over long periods of time. A wide range of metals and minerals can be measured in one sample to provide status of cellular activity and nutrient metabolism. Every physiological function in the body is catalysed by minerals which makes this test so important.

Since the structure of hair remains unchanged, the minerals are fixed in the hair and levels in hair do not significantly change once that portion of hair has grown. The analysis accurately provides concentrations of minerals that have accumulated in the hair tissue over the hair growth period, approximately one to three months.

Heavy metal toxicity can be caused by exposure to pollution, chemicals, poisons the work place, the water and the food supply. It is a growing threat to the population as metals deposit in body tissues leading to significant developmental and neurological damage.  Heavy metal toxicities can also lead to numerous health conditions including those affecting the cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, muscle, skeletal, skin and nervous systems.
<h3>Which hair can I get tested?</h3>
Any hair group can be used for testing these include head hair, chest hair and pubic hair.
<h3>Who benefits from a hair mineral analysis?</h3>
Everybody can benefit greatly from a hair mineral analysis including children, this is because toxic metal exposure and essential mineral imbalances are one of the biggest problems most people face today.  Here are some common conditions associated with hair mineral imbalances and toxic metal exposure:
<ul>
 	<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
 	<li>Auto immune disease</li>
 	<li>Immune dysfunction</li>
 	<li>Toxicity</li>
 	<li>Muscular skeletal conditions</li>
 	<li>Metabolic syndrome</li>
 	<li>Skin conditions</li>
 	<li>Immune and inflammatory condition</li>
 	<li>Mental health disorders</li>
 	<li>Allergies</li>
 	<li>Chronic disease</li>
 	<li>Cancer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Does hair mineral analysis really work?</h3>
Yes, hair analysis is used by governments, scientific and medical authorities and has been for decades, hair analysis is also often used in forensic science and continues to be a scientifically valid way to evaluate many different things about an individual.

<h2>Cardio Genetic Test (Buccal Swab)</h2>
<h3>Do you have a cardiovascular genetic problem?</h3>
The Cardio genetic test uses genomic testing to identify the risk of genetic susceptibility to cardiac related diseases and conditions. Specifically, the Cardio test evaluates genetic variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that modulate blood pressure regulation, lipid balance, nutrient metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress.  Genetic testing enables one to minimize the risk by:
<ul>
 	<li>Identifying hidden gene mutations that may promote chronic disease</li>
 	<li>Preventing disease through early intervention</li>
 	<li>Modifying gene expression through more precise, targeted, individualised interventions</li>
 	<li>Identifying key areas for follow-up testing</li>
 	<li>Monitoring therapeutic effectiveness of intervention</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Cardio Genetic Test (Buccal Swab)</h3>
The cardio genetic test is a buccal swab test that can be done right from you home or office.  The test includes:
<ul>
 	<li>The test kit</li>
 	<li>The test kit full instructions</li>
 	<li>Express post overnight return delivery to laboratory</li>
 	<li>Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 10-12 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone so you’ll know exactly what you need to do if the results come back positive.</strong></li>

<h3>About These Genes</h3>
Whether or not you choose to see genes, they are always there and will continue to play an important role in one’s health. With genomic testing, by choosing to look at them, you have the opportunity to influence the ultimate outcome and more actively promote a healthy life.  The genes tested include:
<ul>
 	<li>AGT (angiotensin)</li>
 	<li>AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor-1)</li>
 	<li>APOE (Apolipoprotein E)</li>
 	<li>CETP (choletseryl ester transfer protein)</li>
 	<li>CYBA*8</li>

<h2>Insulin Resistance Test</h2>
<h3>Do you have insulin resistance, are you going to be diabetic?</h3>
The insulin resistance test is a simple blood test that you can do right near your home or office,  The test only takes a minute and takes an accurate account of your insulin hormone levels, it measures your body’s resistance to insulin.  The insulin resistance test is great for discovering imbalances in insulin hormones that contribute to diabetes, obesity or weight problems, cardiovascular disease &amp; the discovery of syndrome X or metabolic syndrome.
<h3>The Insulin Resistance Test</h3>
The insulin resistance test is a simple blood test that can be done right near your home or office.  This test is an important hormone test that tells you if you are resistant to insulin.  The test looks at fasting glucose, fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) The test includes:
<ul>
 	<li>An authorized blood specimen order form that you take to your local accredited pathology for collection of your blood (<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/pathology-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Find a pathology near you here</strong></a>).</li>
 	<li>A blood specimen test kit for the pathology to use to collect your blood sample</li>

Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 7-10 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone.</strong>
<h3>About Insulin Resistance</h3>
Insulin resistance is a key component of Metabolic Syndrome along with abdominal obesity, elevated LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, low HDL cholesterol, and high blood pressure. This resistance is seen in both endogenous insulin production as well as resistance to the effects of exogenous insulin administered by injection.

A strong family history of diabetes is a major risk factor for high levels of insulin resistance, along with high GI carbohydrate intake including excessive alcohol consumption; lack of regular exercise; stress, and <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/nutritional-balance-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">nutritional deficiencies</a> such as chromium, vanadium, and magnesium.

Higher levels of pancreatic insulin synthesis are required to maintain normal blood sugar levels.  Increasing insulin hormone scores reflect pre-diabetes, <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/organic-acids-test-ketonefatty-acid-metabolites/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">metabolic disorders</a> &amp; or syndrome X.  This test is therefore a major advantage in early detection to reverse these conditions through nutritional intervention.  Those who have already been diagnosed as diabetic can also benefit greatly from the interventions used as a result of a positive test to insulin resistance.
<h3>Signs of insulin resistance</h3>
There are many signs and symptoms associated with insulin resistance, here are just some:
<ul>
 	<li>Obesity</li>
 	<li>Pre-diabetes</li>
 	<li>Syndrome X (a chemical imbalance that makes you fat)</li>
 	<li>Metabolic syndrome (problems with metabolism of sugar &amp; fat)</li>
 	<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
 	<li>Hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure)</li>
 	<li>Hypercholesterolaemia (an excess of cholesterol in the bloodstream)</li>
 	<li>Hypertriglyceridaemia (Elevated levels of triglycerides)</li>

Arginine HCL is a synthetically manufactured form of Arginine that combines the amino acid with a hydrogen chloride molecule. Hydrogen chloride is combined with Arginine to make the supplement more palatable and to enhance its absorption by the digestive system.
<h3>Arginine HCL and Athletic Performance</h3>
One of the main effects of Arginine is that it causes vasodilation, by stimulating the smooth muscle endothelial cells that line the blood vessels to produce a compound called nitric oxide.  Nitric oxide stimulates blood vessels to relax and expand, increasing the flow of blood and oxygen to the muscles during bouts of intense exercise, especially resistance training.

An increase in blood flow and oxygen delivery during exercise may enhance performance, allowing muscles to produce more strength and delaying the onset of exercise induced fatigue.
<h3>Arginine HCL and Hormone Production</h3>
Arginine is an important catalyst for the production of human growth hormone, or HGH.  When ingested, Arginine HCL stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release HGH, increasing plasma levels of HGH circulating throughout the body.  Naturally elevated levels of HGH have many benefits, including an increase in muscle recovery and repair, regulation of metabolism, body fat reduction, and the optimal functioning of the heart and kidneys.
<h3>Other Benefits of Arginine HCL</h3>
MedlinePlus reports that possible benefits of Arginine HCL supplementation include improving surgery recovery time, treating congestive heart
failure, reducing chest pain in coronary artery disease, reducing bladder inflammation, treating erectile dysfunction, improving kidney function, and maintaining a healthy body weight in individuals suffering from muscle-wasting diseases such as HIV.
<h3>Possible Side Effects</h3>
Arginine HCL may have adverse effects on individuals who have liver and kidney disease, as well as on some individuals recovering from a heart attack.  Arginine HCL may also upset the balance of potassium in the bloodstream.  With a potassium deficiency, Arginine may cause dehydration, nausea, stomach cramps and diarrhea. Monitor use with blood thinning medications.

Individuals with chronically low blood pressure are advised not to take Arginine, as it may lower blood pressure even further, leading to fatigue and dizziness.  Arginine supplementation can aggravate a herpes simplex conditions, those that have herpes simplex should avoid arginine supplementation.
<strong>Dosage</strong>

L-Arginine is generally well absorbed orally and can be added to foods or liquids.   Studies suggest an average adult serving would be between 2 and 20gm depending on diet and other contributing factors. The recommended dosage of Arginine varies depending on the treatment.

• For congestive heart failure, MedlinePlus recommends doses ranging from 6g to 20g per day, which varies on a case-by-case basis.
• For relieving chest pain caused by clogged arteries, 9 g to 28 g of Arginine is taken in equal increments three or four times daily.
• Men suffering from erectile dysfunction may benefit from 5g of L Arginine per day.
• 6 g per day is an effective dosage for improving physical performance.

The Tartrate form is recognized as being the most natural and well absorbed of the Carnitine family.  While acetyl Carnitine is important for brain development, L-Carnitine tartrate excels at weight loss, heart health and energy creation.

The following are all linked to the benefits of the tartrate form of Carnitine:
<h3>Therapeutic Use</h3>
Experts say that L Carnitine is currently one of the best-researched dietary supplement in the world and has every appearance of being a proven remedy. Moreover, it is non-toxic, with minimal contraindications and adverse interactions, and well-tolerated by young and old.

Whenever an organism needs energy, L-Carnitine plays an important role such as:

• Fat Burning: L-Carnitine mainly increases the rate at which fat is burned. This tends to reduce fat and build up lean muscle mass.
• Fatty Acid Transport: L Carnitine is best known as a facilitator of the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation.
• Exercise performance: The second lesser known role is in maintaining high density exercise via lactic acid minimization
• Heart Health: Minimizing the risk of heart disease

<strong>FYI</strong>:
Healthy subjects consumed a high fat meal, which has been shown to cause impairment of vascular health. It was demonstrated in a trial that 2g of L-Carnitine taken with the meal enhanced vascular responses (increased dilation) to the high fat meal. This was most apparent in those subjects who had the greatest decrease in vascular function. Because vascular dysfunction is an early event in heart disease, Carnitine supplementation can be viewed as a preventative or therapeutic supplement to improve risk for heart disease.
<h3>Contraindications</h3>
The only contraindications for the use of l-Carnitine are to do with specific diseases and conditions such as:

• Seizures: If you have ever had a seizure, you should avoid using l-Carnitine. For people with a history of seizures, the use of L-Carnitine has produced an increase in the seriousness and number of seizures, whether taken intravenously or orally.

• Hypothyroidism: if you have an under-active thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism, l-Carnitine tartrate may interact with the hormones produced by the thyroid and could have a negative effect. If you know you have hypothyroidism, it is best to avoid taking additionally l-Carnitine tartrate.

<strong>Dosage</strong>
2 grams: Most studies are done at this dose, taking Carnitine post training Take with carbs (40-80 grams) for an insulin spike to help shunt Carnitine into muscle tissue for peak performance.

<h3>Do you need N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine?  <span style=""color: #ff6600;""><a style=""color: #ff6600;"" href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/amino-acid-analysis-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Take the amino acid test here.</a></span></h3>
N-acetyl D glucosamine (NAG) is a type of monosaccharide that is also related to glucose and is chemically similar to glucosamine. However, unlike glucose, N-acetyl glucosamine is not really a sugar but belongs to a class of compounds called amides, although it is commonly described as a carbohydrate.

NAG occurs naturally in the outer shells of certain insects and shellfish and is synthesized from the reaction between glucosamine and acetic acid. Although NAG can be found in certain cosmetic products where it is used as an exfoliating and anti-wrinkle agent, its main use is as a dietary supplement in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
<h3>IBS, Crohn’s and Colitis</h3>
The protective wall of the GIT incorporates N-acetyl glucosamine. NAG shows promise in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (a class of conditions that includes Crohn's disease, from impaired innate immunity which is an abnormal immune response to microbial invasion, and for colitis), according to a pilot study published in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics in 2000. Testing on children with severe Crohn's disease and severe ulcerative colitis were conducted. Researchers found that daily treatment with N-acetyl glucosamine led to a significant improvement in symptoms and a decrease of inflammation in damaged soft tissue of the GIT in these children.
<h3>Auto Immune disease</h3>
A 2011 study from the Journal of Biological Chemistry indicates that N-acetyl glucosamine may help suppress the destructive autoimmune response involved in multiple sclerosis.  As Glucosamine Sulphate and HCL are also currently used in the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis, it would be logical to assume that NAG could be used as it suppresses the auto immune response as well as exerts anti inflammatory effects.
<h3>How it works</h3>
NAG is the more direct route to the important macromolecules such as hyaluronic acid, keratin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Unlike the low-molecular glucosamine found in glucosamine sulfate or glucosamine hydrochloride, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is an advanced molecule that requires fewer enzymatic steps before being incorporated into the macromolecules of cartilage. Given that N-acetyl glucosamine saves the user several
biochemical steps involved in the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to N-acetyl glucosamine, it makes an effective product for the treatment of Crohn’s disease for example.

Tissue biopsies taken from gastrointestinal tracts of Crohn’s patients showed decreased glucosamine synthetase activity in the inflamed tissues. Because of the loss of this important structural carbohydrate, the inflamed tissues experience rapid loss of epithelial cells.
<h3>Suitable for Diabetics</h3>
NAG does not interfere with glucose metabolism. Low-molecular glucosamine, as in glucosamine sulfate or glucosamine hydrochloride, has been associated with glucose uptake in patients. This probably occurs because low-molecular-weight glucosamine inhibits glucokinase.  Because N-acetyl-D-glucosamine has its own kinase it is not dependent on glucokinase and does not cause a rise in glucose levels when consumed.
<h3>Note on Shellfish allergy</h3>
Shellfish allergy is triggered by the meat of seafood and not by their shells. Therefore, shellfish allergy does not involve chitin or N-acetyl glucosamine. This means that those with shellfish allergy call safely take the supplement.
<h3>Contra Indications</h3>
How safe is N-acetyl glucosamine? The results of current safety studies suggest that N-acetyl glucosamine is very safe. However, N-acetyl glucosamine is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as those who are about to undergo surgery.  It should be used cautiously by patients who also suffer from asthma, bleeding disorders and kidney problems.  N-acetyl glucosamine should not be combined with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin.
<h3>
Side Effects</h3>
None noted

<strong>Dosage</strong>
3-6 gram daily in divided doses. NAG dissolves readily and is heat stable, so can be added to hot beverages.

<h3>Athletic Use</h3>
Glutamine is stored in skeletal muscle along with other sites in the body including the intestine, brain and lung. Not much is written about its use in sports medicine and the idea of Glutamine as a muscle repair agent is not well studied, but is used regardless.
<h3>Other Uses</h3>
• Glutamine is used to counter some of the side effects of medical treatments. For example, it is used for side effects of cancer chemotherapy including diarrhea, pain and swelling inside the mouth (mucositis), nerve pain (neuropathy), and muscle and joint pains caused by the cancer drug Taxol.
• Glutamine is also used to protect the immune system and digestive system in people undergoing radio/chemotherapy for cancer of the esophagus..
• Additionally, glutamine is used for improving recovery after bone marrow transplant or bowel surgery, increasing well-being in people who have suffered traumatic injuries, and preventing infections in critically ill people. After surgery or traumatic injury, nitrogen is necessary to repair the wounds and keep the vital organs functioning. About one third of this nitrogen comes from glutamine.
• Some people use glutamine for digestive system conditions such as stomach ulcers, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease. It is also used for depression, moodiness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia (not as much evidence)
• People who have HIV can use glutamine to prevent weight loss (HIV wasting) This is because the body uses more glutamine than it can replace where there are muscle wasting diseases present
• Glutamine is also used for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a urinary condition called cystinuria, sickle cell anemia, and for alcohol withdrawal support.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

For adults ages 18 and older: Doses of 500mg, 1 - 3 times daily, are generally considered safe and used for general stomach complaints and wound healing, doses as high as 5,000 - 15,000 mg daily (in divided doses), or sometimes higher, may be prescribed by a health care provider for certain conditions. These include Crohn’s and chemotherapy support.
<h3>Caution</h3>
People with kidney disease, liver disease, or Reye syndrome (a rare, sometimes fatal disease affecting children that is generally associated with aspirin use) should not take glutamine.  Some people exhibit signs of excitability and wakefulness when taking glutamine and could be converting Glutamine to Glutamic acid, which could explain these symptoms.

<h3>Athletic Use</h3>
• Control blood sugar levels and protect against ATP depletion, optimizing energy levels
• While too much Glycine in the body can cause fatigue, having the proper amount produces the opposite effect - more energy.
• As one of the few amino acids that helps improve blood-sugar storage, some experts suggest Glycine may increase energy for endurance activities.
• Glycine has been shown to help slow muscle breakdown by supplying Creatine to the
muscle cells.
• For growth-hormone release, Glycine is reportedly more effective when used with ornithine, arginine, glutamine, tyrosine, Vitamin B6, niacinamide, zinc, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and/or Vitamin C.
<h3>Other uses</h3>
Antacid: Glycine is also used as an antacid agent and is reportedly effective for limiting stomach discomfort. In addition, it may help shuttle toxic substances out of the body.  Prostate: Because the prostate contains considerable amounts of Glycine, this nutrient may help promote prostate health. In fact, one study found that Glycine, taken with alanine and glutamic acid, reduced the amount of swelling in the prostate tissue.

CNS Function: Glycine is necessary for central nervous system function. Research has shown that this amino acid can help inhibit the  neurotransmitters that cause seizure activity, hyperactivity, and manic (bipolar) depression. Glycine can also be converted to another neurotransmitter, serine, as needed, and may be beneficial in the management of schizophrenia.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

Athletic and Other Use: 2-6 grams daily
CNS: 4 gram daily until desired effect is reached. Some clinical trials with schizophrenic patients use 40 to 90 grams daily (based on .8 gm per kg body weight)
Ischemic Stroke: Putting 1 teaspoon Glycine under the tongue may help to limit brain damage caused by an ischemic stroke when started within 6 hours of having the stroke.
Leg ulcers: A cream containing 10 mg of Glycine, 2 mg of L-cysteine, and 1 mg of DL-threonine per gram of cream has been used. The cream is applied at each wound cleaning and dressing change once daily, every other day, or twice daily as needed.
<h3>Caution</h3>
Individuals with kidney or liver disease should not consume Glycine without consulting their doctor. Taking any one glycerol based amino acid supplement can cause a disruption of the citric acid or Krebs cycle, and cause a build-up of nitrogen or ammonia in the body, which makes the liver and kidneys work harder to remove waste.

Clozapine (Clozaril) is used to help treat schizophrenia. Taking Glycine along with clozapine (Clozaril) might decrease the effectiveness of clozapine (Clozaril). It is not clear why this interaction occurs yet. Do not take Glycine if you are taking clozapine (Clozaril).

<h3>Possible Uses for</h3>
Panic disorder: Inositol shows some promise for controlling panic attacks and the fear of public places or open spaces (agoraphobia). One study found that inositol is as effective as a prescription medication. However, large-scale clinical trials are needed before inositols effectiveness for panic attacks can be proven.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): There is some evidence that people with OCD who receive inositol by mouth for 6 weeks experience significant improvement.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Taking a particular form of inositol (isomer D-chiroinositol) by mouth seems to lower triglyceride and testosterone levels, modestly decrease blood pressure, and promote ovulation in obese or insulin resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Myo inositol is thought to be converted to D Chiro inositol in the body. When using Myo inositol for PCOS, the dose should be two-three times higher than using D Chiro inositol alone. Studies into conception show the myo form stimulates ovulation better than the D Chiro form.

Problems breathing in premature infants known as “acute respiratory distress syndrome” when given intravenously (by IV).

Psoriasis brought on or made worse by lithium drug therapy. Inositol doesn’t seem to help psoriasis in people not taking lithium.

FYI: Bipolar disorder: There is some concern that taking too much inositol might make bipolar disorder worse. There is a report of a man with controlled bipolar disorder being hospitalized with extreme agitation and impulsiveness (mania) after drinking several cans of an energy drink
containing inositol, caffeine, taurine, and other ingredients (Red Bull Energy Drink) over a period of 4 days. It is not known if this is related to inositol, caffeine, taurine, a different ingredient, or a combination of the ingredients.

<strong>Dosage</strong>
• For panic disorder: 12 to 18 grams per day
• For obsessive-compulsive disorder: inositol 18 grams per day.
• For treating symptoms associated with polycystic ovary syndrome: D-chiro-inositol 2 gram per day
• For treating lithium-related psoriasis: 6 grams daily

<h3>Athletic performance</h3>
Lysine is important for proper growth, and it plays an essential role in the production of Carnitine, and is sometimes taken with the 2:1 Arginine to Ornithine ratio to produce HGH.
<h3>Other Uses</h3>
Lysine appears to help the body absorb calcium, and it plays an important role in the formation of collagen, a substance important for bones and connective tissues including skin, tendon, and cartilage, so may help prevent osteoporosis.  Most people get enough lysine in their diet, although athletes, vegans who don't eat beans, as well as burn patients may need more.

Some studies have found that taking lysine on a regular basis may help prevent outbreaks of cold sores and genital herpes. Lysine has antiviral effects by blocking the activity or Arginine, which promotes HSV (Herpes simplex virus)replication. Studies suggest oral lysine is more effective for preventing an HSV outbreak than it is at reducing the severity and duration of an outbreak. One study found that taking lysine at the beginning of a herpes outbreak did not reduce symptoms.  Lab studies suggest that lysine in combination with L-Arginine makes bone building cells more active and enhances production of collagen (possibly by association with HGH)

<strong>Dosage</strong>

• For adults ages 13 and older: Recommendations are 12 mg/kg/day.
• An example of a dose often used during an active herpes flare up is 3 – 9 gram per day in divided doses for a short period of time. To prevent recurrences, many people take 2-3 gram daily.  Lysine in the diet is considered safe. High doses have caused gallstones. There have also been reports of renal dysfunction, including Fanconi's syndrome and renal failure.  Use with lysine may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

<h3>Athletic Uses</h3>
In addition to its role as a precursor in protein synthesis, L-methionine participates in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM or SAMe), L-cysteine, glutathione, taurine and sulfate.  Methionine is also a glycogenic amino acid and may participate in the formation of Dglucose and glycogen so may help with energy production and stamina.
<h3>Other Uses</h3>
Liver detoxification: The ability of L-methionine to reduce the liver-toxic effects of such hepatotoxins as acetaminophen and methotrexate has led to the suggestion that methionine should be added to acetaminophen products. However, there is some recent research suggesting that elevated L-methionine intake may promote intestinal carcinogenesis. This is unclear.

Heavy Metal Toxicity: L-methionine is involved in the formation of many substances containing protein, as well as providing sulphur. It is necessary for the bonding and excretion of toxic heavy metal compounds.

UTI’s (Urinary Tract Infections): Methionine is also capable of pushing the pH-value of urine into the acidic part of the scale, reducing the occurrence of cystitis and other urinary tract infections.  The effectiveness and efficiency of ampicillin and other antibiotics is also improved where the pH-value ranges between 4 and 6.
<h3>Absorption</h3>
Some metabolism of L-methionine takes place within the intestines. That which is not metabolized is transported to the liver via the portal circulation. In the liver, Lmethionine, along with other amino acids, participates in protein biosynthesis. It may also participate in a wide variety of metabolic reactions, including the formation of SAMe, L-homocysteine, L-cysteine, taurine and sulfate. There is where it is also metabolized to produce D-glucose and glycogen.

L-methionine not metabolized in the liver is transported to the various tissues of the body where it is involved in reactions similar to those described above.
<h3>Cautions and Interactions</h3>
• One of the metabolites of L-methionine, <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">L-homocysteine</a>, has been implicated as a significant factor in coronary heart disease and other vascular diseases. Perhaps taking Methionine with taurine, B6,B12 &amp; Folate may counter this production.  <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Learn more about homocysteine here</a>.
• Amino acids like methionine, Creatine and SAMe can inhibit your absorption of the Parkinson's disease medication L Dopa warn the University Of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
• In general, it is recommended while you're taking methionine supplements to take extra B-complex vitamins, particularly vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folate. This is because taking methionine while you have a B-vitamin deficiency could increase your blood levels of <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">homocysteine</a> and cholesterol, both of which are linked to elevated risks for atherosclerosis.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

• Even without B-vitamin deficiencies, taking high doses of methionine -7g daily or morecan increase your homocysteine levels.
• Studies show taking up to 2g per day of methionine doesn't appear to cause any serious adverse effects.

<h3>Athletic Performance</h3>
Stimulation of HGH in combination with Arginine HCL.  Results suggest that L-Ornithine has an anti fatigue effect in increasing the efficiency of energy consumption.
<h3>Other Uses</h3>
Ornithine is the driving force of action of the enzyme Arginase which creates Urea.  Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen and ammonia.  Ornithine uses Ammonia and Nitrogen to produce urea which is then excreted by the kidney.

Used in Parasite Cleansing to mop up ammonia produced from parasites. Excessive ammonia can cause insomnia, according to Dr Hulda Clarke.
Possibly an adjunct treat ammonia and nitrogen (shown in blood tests).  Useful for wound healing post surgery proline and glutamic acid, all of which play a role in healing.

Interesting Note: High ammonia levels can occur for a variety of reasons.  Causes for elevated ammonia in your blood include parasites, liver failure, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, Reye's syndrome in children, intestinal bleeding, cardiovascular conditions, kidney complications and a rare, inherited disorder of the urea cycle called Citrullinemia. If left untreated, these conditions can lead to complications like a liver abscess.  Early symptoms of high ammonia levels can include difficulties.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

• Parasites: 1-3 grams at night
• Athletes: 3-6 grams. L Ornithine HCL is generally considered safe to take in high doses.

Phenylalanine is found in 3 forms: L-phenylalanine, the natural form found in proteins; Dphenylalanine (a mirror image of L-phenylalanine that is made in a laboratory), and DLphenylalanine, a combination of the 2 forms.
<h3>Athletic and Other Uses</h3>
Metabolism: L-phenylalanine acts primarily on the digestive system and the metabolic rate.  One of phenylalanine's primary functions is to serve as a precursor to the amino acid tyrosine, which in turn is needed to produce the hormone thyroxine.  Appetite Suppression: Phenylalanine also stimulates the release of cholecystokinin, a digestive system hormone that produces a feeling of satiety after eating and decreases interest in eating, as well as being a precursor molecule for the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, a compound that also plays a role in controlling appetite.

Depression: The body changes phenylalanine into tyrosine, which makes proteins, brain chemicals, including L-dopa, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones.  Pain Control: D Phenylalanine (but not L-phenylalanine) has been used to treat chronic pain.  Skin Conditions: Vitiligo. Phenylalanine is a precursor to melanin via L Tyrosine so is used in the treatment of Vitiligo along with sunlight therapy.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

No more than 5 gram a day for any conditions.
More than 5 gm can cause neuropathies.
D, L-Phenylalanine competes with other amino acids. They have to be able to pass through the stomach and blood brain barrier without competition.
The consensus of experts recommends taking phenylalanine on an empty stomach 15-20 minutes before eating. Avoid taking them with other amino acids or other supplements.
It is recommended to start with 500-1,000 mg as soon as you awake. Some people may take another 500-1,000 mg 4-6 hours later.
Taking phenylalanine too close to bedtime may keep you awake.
<h3>Drug Interactions and Cautions</h3>
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are an older class of antidepressants drugs that are rarely used now. They include phenelzine (Nardil), isocarboxazid (Marplan), and tranylcypromine sulfate (Parnate). Taking phenylalanine while taking MAOIs may cause a severe increase in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis).

Levodopa: A few case reports suggest that phenylalanine may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa (Sinemet), a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease.  Antipsychotic drugs can interact with Phenylalanine,  these include chlorpromazine (Thorazine), clozapine (Clozaril), fluphenazine (Prolixin),
haloperidol (Haldol), olanzapine (Zyprexa), perphenazine (Trilafon), prochlorperazine (Compazine), quetiapine (Seroquel), risperidone (Risperdal), thioridazine (Mellaril), thiothixene (Navane), and others.
<h3>Caution</h3>
Melanoma patients should avoid taking L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. Certain cancers, such as melanoma, depend on these amino acids to fuel their growth.  Supplemental use of L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine may raise or normalize blood pressure.

Insomnia may be a side effect if taken too close to bedtime.

Some researchers think L-phenylalanine use can cause a number of side effects, including high blood pressure, nausea, heartburn, difficulty sleeping and mood swings, especially irritability. This is usually due to high dosing.

Proline is the amino acid necessary for the production of collagen and cartilage for healthy joints, ligaments and skin.

L-Proline for Cardiovascular Health:  L-lysine and particularly L-proline are important substrates for the biosynthesis of matrix protein
and competitively inhibit the binding of lipoprotein to the vascular matrix which prevents cholesterol build up and resulting arterial plaque. Maintaining the integrity and physiological function of the vascular wall is the key therapeutic target in controlling cardiovascular disease.

L-Proline for fine lines and wrinkles: When proline is taken, the stability of collagen is increased, making it a desirable supplement for skin integrity and decreasing fine lines and wrinkle.

L-Proline to heal wounds:Proline initiates the biochemical pathway for connective tissue repair and collagen production, therefore increases wound healing and minimizes scar formation.

<strong>Doses</strong>

Reducing cholesterol plaque (sresearch from Linus Pauling)
<h3>Preventative</h3>
Vit C: 3 gm, Lys: 2 gm, Proline 2 gm
<h3>Treatment</h3>
As above, but increasing by 50% more

Skin and wound healing: 2 – 5 gm daily, weight dependent
<h3>Contraindications</h3>
The intake of L-proline may lead to the development of neurological problems such as seizures and intellectual disability in patients with hyperprolinemia, a rare genetic condition caused by the excesses in proline levels, according to the Genetics Home Reference of the National Institutes of Health.

If you have high levels of lactic acid in your blood, you are also predisposed to hyperprolinemia, because lactic acid inhibits the breakdown of proline
People who have chronic kidney failure should not take any amino acid supplement without consultation with their physician Smokers should avoid proline supplements and foods that are high in proline if they eat foods preserved with nitrates or that release nitrates during the process of pickling,
because, in smokers, nitrates can convert proline into the potent carcinogen Nnitrosoproline.

People who have alcohol-related liver disease should not take proline, as they usually already have high levels of proline in the bloodstream. Chronic liver inflammation interferes with the body's ability to make collagen anywhere except in the liver, where proline is used to form the collagen that forms the fibers that cause cirrhosis of the liver.  People who have allergies should avoid proline as it increases levels of histamine in the bloodstream.

<h3>Athletic Performance</h3>
The amino acid Taurine is believed to enhance the effect of adrenalin in the body by increasing the number of adrenalin receptors in the body, but not
enough studies verify this.  The levels of some amino acids can rise in the muscle cells when taking Taurine, specifically glutamine and the BCAAs valine, leucine and isoleucine. It may be that Taurine raises the concentration function of glycogen precursors.
<h3>Other Use</h3>
In a recent study, scientists discovered that taurine supplements may <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">help reduce levels of homocysteine</a>.  Taurine also occurs naturally in the body and plays a key role in many biological processes, such as detoxification and regulation of nerve-cell activity.  Although low levels of taurine have been linked to several conditions (including eye diseases and cardiovascular problems), research on the health benefits of taurine supplements is fairly limited.

There's some evidence that taurine may protect against diabetes and diabetes-related complications and may help prevent the onset of type 2
diabetes.  Published in Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews in 2001, an earlier report indicates that taurine supplementation shows promise in the prevention of certain diabetes-related complications (such as atherosclerosis).

Taurine may help treat high blood pressure, according to a 2002 report published in Amino Acids. Looking at data from preliminary research, the report's authors found that taurine supplementation may lead to significant decreases in blood pressure.  Relieving panic attacks and anxiety due to GABA effects of Taurine.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

<h3>Athletic use</h3>
May speed wound healing and recovery from injury by keeping the connective tissue strong to facilitate faster healing. Threonine is needed to create glycine and serine, two amino acids that are necessary for the production of collagen, elastin, and muscle tissue.  It is also found in significant amounts in the heart.

Liver Function:  Threonine combines with the amino acids aspartic acid and methionine to help the liver with the digestion of fats and fatty acids.
Nervous System Disorders:  Threonine supplementation may be useful in the treatment of Lou Gehrig’s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) where there is a Glycine deficiency. Administering glycine directly is ineffective, since it cannot cross into the central nervous system, so it needs
Threonine to facilitate the shuttle. Research indicates that symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), another disease that affects the nerve and muscle function, may be lessened with threonine supplementation.
<h3>Uric acid reduction</h3>
Uric acid accumulation in the body predisposes the body to Gout. The amino acid threonine, along with glycine, are important compound for the removal of purines - these are compounds that break down into uric acid, which itself is a by-product of protein digestion in the human body.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

When taken in dosage of anything between 2 and 4 grams every day for a maximum period of about 12 months the use of threonine appears to be safe. However, some people using this essential amino acid may suffer from negligible side effects like headache, stomach disorder, queasiness and skin rash.

Nervous System Disorders; ALS, MS; Depression: One 1992 study showed that 7.5 grams of threonine taken daily decreased spasticity among
study participants. Individuals suffering from clinical depression can also benefit from using dosages consisting of one gram of threonine two times daily - this supplementation generates a marked improvement in the affected person.

Tryptophan is an essential amino acid. It is the precursor to 5-hydroxytrypophan (5-HTP) which is the direct precursor to serotonin. Serotonin is important for mood and sleep; when it is deficient, this can lead to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and various other neuropsychological conditions. L Tryptophan works in about 50% of insomnia cases.

Tryptophan is the precursor for vitamin B3 in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Only about 1/60th of the tryptophan in the body is actually converted to NAD.  What conditions respond to Tryptophan?

Mood: Mood disorders, PMT, sleep and other conditions directly affected by reduced Serotonin production and uptake
Skin: Because it is a precursor to B3, Tryptophan may also be useful for dermatitis and pellagra
Weight loss: Tryptophan decreases carbohydrate cravings, and, because of its ability to convert into B3, helps with the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates and proteins.
Condition called cystinuria, sickle cell anemia, and for alcohol withdrawal support.
Absorption into the Brain: The brain typically receives less than one percent of ingested tryptophan. However, getting even this small share of tryptophan is a difficult task for the brain, due to the blood brain barrier (BBB). The BBB makes it hard even for brain essential nutrients to enter the brain. Serotonin by itself cannot penetrate the BBB, but its precursor, tryptophan, can. Nutrients must be ferried through the BBB by transport molecules, and unfortunately for the serotonin-using nerves, tryptophan must share its transportation route with five other amino acids: tyrosine,
phenylalanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine. Taking a supplement therefore, increases the chance of uptake into the brain which food alone may not be able to achieve.
<h3>Beware Serotonin Syndrome</h3>
<p class=""rte align_justify"">This is where there is an excess tryptophan or 5-HTP levels, usually as a result with prescription anti-depressants. Signs and symptoms include: Agitation, confus ioofn ,c odmelbiriinuimng, tachycardia, blood pressure changes.</p>

<h3>Medication Contraindications</h3>
Fluoxetine and related selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norephinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI and SNRI) antidepressants - Addicitve effect can result in rapid onset of severe symptoms but might also be applied purposefully within a tightly managed therapeutic protocol.  Generally avoid concomitant use or under close supervision with a healthcare professional.

Phenelzine and related Monoamine oxidase inhibitors - Concomitant use carries high probability of resulting in clinically significant serotonin excess and major risk of serious adverse effects.  Avoid concomitant use.

Sibutramine and other serotonin antagonists - Concomitant use can lead to clinically significant serotonin excess and major risk of serious adverse effects.  Avoid concomitant use.

Tricyclic antidepressants - Tryptophan can increase the actions of TCAs.  This additive effect can result in rapid onset of severe symptoms but might also be applied purposefully within a tightly managed therapeutic protocol.
<h3>Contraindicated with</h3>
Achlorhydria, bladder cancer, diabetes mellitus, female infertility, psoriasis Possible side effects: Anorexia, dizziness, headaches, dry mouth, nausea Dosages: Anxiety,
<h3>Possible side effects</h3>
Anorexia, dizziness, headaches, dry mouth, nausea

<strong>Dosages</strong>

Anxiety, Depression and PMT: 2-6 gram in divided doses in capsule form or in water between meals. Take with a small amount of carbohydrate to shuttle into the BBB.

Weight Loss and skin:  1-2 grams in divided doses in capsule form or in water between meals.  Take with a small amount of carbohydrate to shuttle inot cells.

Insomnia: 1-3 grams 1 hour before bed with msall amount of carbohydrate.

Although studies show Tryptophan is safe up to 15 gram, stick to maximum dose of 6 grams to prevent serotonin syndrome.

<h3>Athletic Uses</h3>
Supplements that boost the brain's dopamine concentration are of interest to endurance athletes. Some research has suggested that tyrosine might have an effect at a high temperature. At high temperatures athletes tire more quickly. In the brain tyrosine is converted – also via L-Dopa – into dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that motivates people to continue and suppresses feelings of fatigue and is activated by high temperatures produced by aerobic activity.
<h3>Other Uses</h3>
Cognitive function:  In addition, a 2007 study of 19 people (published in Physiology &amp; Behavior) found that use of tyrosine supplements helped protect against the detrimental effects of severe cold exposure on cognitive performance and memory.

Depression and mood disorders:  Tyrosine (actually L-tyrosine) is an amino acid precursor of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. Taking tyrosine on an empty stomach is supposed to cause an increase in norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which can lead to increased energy, alertness and improved moods, thus relieving depression.

Unlike St John's wort, that can take two months to work, and prescription antidepressants, which probably won't kick in for about six weeks, tyrosine works very quickly. However, because it can raise blood pressure in some people, it must be used cautiously by individuals with hypertension and can also cause anxiety.

Healing the thyroid can be a useful adjunct in the treatment of depression. As a precursor of the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triidothyronine, L tyrosine can help to elevate mood and promote well-being that is hindered by low thyroid function.

PKU (phenylketonuria)  This serious condition occurs in people whose bodies can't use the amino acid phenylalanine. It can lead to brain damage, including intellectual disability. People with PKU must avoid any phenylalanine in their diets. Because tyrosine is made from phenylalanine,
people with PKU can be deficient in tyrosine.

<strong>Dosage</strong>

Thyroid Function and Mood disorders: 500-1000 mg twice daily
PKU 500-1000mg once daily
Take L Tyrosine at least 30 minutes before meals, divided into 2-3 daily doses.
Taking vitamins B6, B9 (folate), and copper along with tyrosine helps the body convert tyrosine into important brain chemicals. There is no research to indicate taking Tyrosine in juice enhances absorption
<h3>Possible Interactions</h3>
Be cautious with the following: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) -- Tyrosine may cause a severe increase in blood pressure in people taking antidepressant medications known as MAOIs. This rapid increase in blood pressure, also called ""hypertensive crisis,” can lead to a heart attack or
stroke. People taking MAOIs should avoid foods and supplements containing tyrosine.

MAOIs include:

Isocarboxazid (Marplan)
Phenelzine (Nardil)
Tranylcypromine (Parnate)
Selegiline

Thyroid hormones -- Tyrosine is a precursor to thyroid hormone, so it might raise levels too high when taken with synthetic thyroid hormones. (Moniter) Levodopa (L-dopa) -- Tyrosine should not be taken at the same time as levodopa, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease. Levodopa may interfere with the absorption of tyrosine.

</ul>
Test results are sent to one of our professional health practitioners within 3 – 5 business days for evaluation.  <strong>Our practitioners contact you with the results and recommendations on any findings via email, mail or phone.</strong>
<h3>Why test electrolytes?</h3>
Many people believe that consuming enough water is all that is needed to remain hydrated and while part of this is true these are lots of people who remain dehydrated regardless of the amount of water they consume.  <strong>Electrolyte imbalances are quite common</strong> and may be caused by several conditions. If electrolyte imbalances are not assessed or treated this may lead to a dysfunction of vital body systems, such as the muscles and brain.

Dehydration is a serious problem, it is in many ways one of the most fundamental health concerns we have so testing for electrolytes can reveal if you have an electrolyte imbalances that come from any of the following problems:
<ul>
 	<li>You can't drink enough water</li>
 	<li>You don't feel satisfied by drinking water</li>
 	<li>Essential electrolytes are missing from your water supply</li>
 	<li>You use a water filter that can remove essential electrolytes</li>
 	<li>You feel dehydrated, you have dry skin, dry eyes &amp; or dry mouth</li>
</ul>
<h3>Signs and symptoms of electrolyte imbalances</h3>
• Eating disorder
• Fatigue
• Muscle pain
• Headache
• Nausea/vomiting
• Bowel irregularities
• Heart problems
• Kidney issues
<h3>What electrolytes we test for</h3>
Many people have imbalances of the following nutrients, chemicals and proteins that cause serious health problems, therefore we test for the following imbalances in:

• Sodium (Na)
• Potassium (K)
• Chlorine (CI)
• Bicarbonate (HCO3)
• Urea
• eGFR
• Creatinine
<h3>About electrolytes</h3>
Electrolytes are important minerals that are found in the body. Optimal electrolyte levels are important as they keep the bodies fluids in balance and help your body to function healthy. More specifically, Electrolytes move fluid in and out of your cells, carry nutrients into the cells and waste products back out as well as help the acids and bases in your blood stay in balance.

<h3>The Main Problem With MTHFR</h3>
<div>Folate is a water soluble B vitamin (B9), which humans cannot make in their body and is thus a dietary requirement. The primary function of folate is the transfer of methyl and formyl groups. It is essential for cell growth and reproduction, the formation of certain amino acids (methionine, serine, glycine, and histidine), the breakdown of proteins (e.g. <a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">homocysteine</a>), the formation of DNA and RNA, red blood cell maturation, and serotonin, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and dopamine formation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>MTHFR gene mutation makes it much harder for the body to use folate which causes problems for many of the normal chemical pathways of the body.</div>

<h3>Folate Metabolism</h3>
Folate metabolism is the methylation cycle of folate, it is a biochemical pathway that manages or contributes to a wide range of biochemical functions such as detoxification, supporting DNA (turning genes on and off), producing energy, reducing inflammation, synthesizing neurotransmitters, homocysteine metabolism, protein methylation, phase 2 liver detoxification and supporting immune function.

Inadequate methylation of the folate pathway capacity can lead to birth defects, depression, cognitive decline, physical pain and cancer.  Impaired methylation has even been associated with autism.  Support of methylation markers has been associated with rapid return of speech, improvement of behavior in ADD and ADHD.
<h3>About The Folate Metabolism Test</h3>
After you purchase the folate metabolism test, you will receive a simple blood test kit in the mail.  The test kit comes with:
<ul>
 	<li>An authorized blood specimen order form that you take to your local accredited pathology for collection of your blood (<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/pathology-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Find a pathology near you here</strong></a>).</li>

<h3>What do we test for?</h3>
The folate metabolism test looks at a combination of important folate pathways to see if they are working properly, these include:
<ul>
 	<li>5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5MTHF)</li>
 	<li>Folinic acid</li>
 	<li>Tetrahydrofolate (THF)</li>
 	<li>Active vitamin B12</li>
 	<li>Serum folate</li>
 	<li>Homocysteine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems with folic acid</h3>
Many nutritional supplements provide folic acid which is a synthetic man made substance, many people especially those with certain gene mutations can not use this form of folic acid efficiently which leads to serious methylation problems.  Further, folic acid can build up in your body over time as a by-product of un-methylated folic acid that has been shown to lower your immune systems natural killer cells.

Therefore elevated folic acid readings on a blood report from your doctor may indicate an inability to properly metabolize folate or folic acid.
<h3>Supplementing folate &amp; warnings</h3>
Many people who are concerned about having folate deficiency use supplements to help prevent folate deficiency, many are now learning that they can bypass the folate deficiency by supplementing the activated forms of folate, this is a very bad idea.

Taking activated folate supplements without the supervision of an experienced practitioner <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">can be dangerous</span>, this is because activated folate can cause serious problems such as methyl trapping which can seriously affect <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/neurotransmitter-test-extensive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">neurotransmitters</a> leading to severe depression.  Testing for folate metabolism is the safest &amp; best way to know what you need and don't need to do.
<h3>Genetics &amp; folate metabolism</h3>
Some people are genetically pre programmed with an inability to use folic acid and or folate properly, these people represent approximately 50% of society.  The gene mutation called MTHFR is responsible for the problem.  Those that have been diagnosed with the gene problem are <strong>highly encouraged to take the folate metabolism test</strong> as these people will have the biggest problem with folate metabolism.  Those that are unsure but suspect they may have a folate problem should <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/mthfr-gene-mutation-home-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">take the MTHFR home test here</a>.

<h3>Is your methionine metabolism working properly?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>What is Methionine and Its Importance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methionine is an essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. As a building block of proteins, it is vital for the synthesis of proteins and the regulation of gene expression. Methionine is also a key player in the metabolism of fatty acids. One of its most important roles is in the methylation cycle, where it contributes to adding methyl donors to DNA, gene markers, and proteins, keeping them physiologically active. This process is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and overall health. Additionally, methionine is involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the body’s main methyl donor, which is necessary for the proper functioning of the methylation cycle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Understanding Homocysteine and Its Relationship with Methionine</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Homocysteine is a non-essential amino acid that is closely related to methionine. In the body, homocysteine is converted back to methionine through the action of the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Elevated homocysteine levels can be a sign of impaired methylation capacity, which can lead to various health problems. High homocysteine levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, skeletal abnormalities, and cognitive decline. Excess homocysteine can damage the lining of blood vessels, leading to the formation of blood clots and increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Monitoring homocysteine levels is crucial for assessing the risk of these health issues.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/l-methionine-amino-acid"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Methionine</a> is an essential <a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/amino-acids"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">amino acid</a> that has a wide variety of jobs to do in the body, and one of the most important of these jobs is in methylation. When you have <a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/common-health-problems/do-you-have-problems-with-methylation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">methylation problems</a>, this can lead to serious health problems and disease. Methionine metabolism is therefore a very important indicator for many serious health problems that can lead to <a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">homocysteine imbalances</a>. Measuring homocysteine concentration in the blood is crucial in diagnosing deficiencies in B vitamins like B12 and folate, which can lead to elevated levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The homocysteine test is significant in evaluating risks associated with vitamin B deficiencies and cardiovascular health. It helps diagnose potential deficiencies, assess risks for heart disease, and determine the presence of inherited conditions like homocystinuria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When this happens, your body can’t convert important nutrients that keep you healthy such as:</p>

<h3>The importance of methionine metabolism as an essential amino acid</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methionine metabolism is vitally important, often methionine metabolism can become imbalanced leading to <a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/common-health-problems/do-you-have-problems-with-methylation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">methylation problems</a> such as under or over methylation which comes with a variety of common health problems (<a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/common-health-problems/do-you-have-problems-with-methylation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">See symptoms here</a>). Methionine belongs to a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM or SAMe), L-cysteine, glutathione, taurine and sulfate. The enzyme cystathionine beta synthase plays a crucial role in converting homocysteine, and its deficiency leads to homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive condition with significant physiological and clinical implications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is the process where certain nutrients called ‘methyl donors’ are added to specific elements of DNA, our gene markers and proteins that keep them physiologically active. Methylation is a major pathway to focus on in understanding autoimmune and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, dementia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, depression, anxiety and autism spectrum disorders. Inborn errors, particularly those affecting methionine and homocysteine metabolism, can lead to elevated levels of these metabolites, resulting in conditions like homocystinuria and methylmalonic acidemia, necessitating biochemical evaluations for diagnosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methionine metabolism is involved in DNA production (turning genes on and off). Methionine is also responsible for producing energy, reducing inflammation, synthesising neurotransmitters, homocysteine metabolism, protein methylation, phase 2 liver detoxification and supporting immune function. When methionine metabolism becomes impaired you can expect serious health problems such as:</p>

<h3>Factors Affecting Methionine Metabolism</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several factors can influence methionine metabolism, including dietary intake, genetic variations (SNPs), and deficiencies in essential cofactors such as vitamin B6 and folic acid. A deficiency in methionine can lead to a decrease in the body’s main methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), disrupting the methylation cycle. Conversely, elevated methionine levels can result from increased dietary intake or supplementation, abnormalities in the methylation cycle, or genetic SNPs. Ensuring a balanced intake of methionine and its cofactors is essential for maintaining proper methylation and overall health.</p>

<h3>Methionine Imbalances and Elevated Homocysteine Levels</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeping the right balance of methionine is critical, too much methionine production or supplementation can cause <strong>over-methylation.</strong> On the other hand not enough methionine can lead to <strong>under-methylation</strong> (<a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/common-health-problems/do-you-have-problems-with-methylation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">read more about these conditions here</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elevated homocysteine levels, often resulting from methionine imbalances, can increase the risk of coronary artery disease and heart attacks. While there is a connection between high homocysteine levels and coronary artery blockage, the exact role of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease is still debated, with ongoing research about its utility in risk assessment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methionine metabolism problems often lead to <a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/heavy-metal-toxicity/heavy-metal-toxicity-destroying-health"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">heavy metal toxicity</a>, this is because methionine lends itself to liver detoxification of the heavy metals which of course come with their own set of symptoms depending on which heavy metals are found.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methionine is a good predictor of good or bad health and can help warn you about current health problems that you are not aware of and can help prevent serious health problems in the future, you can lean more about this through the <a href=""https://naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">symptoms associated with homocysteine</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Methionine metabolism problems can look like nutritional imbalances, this is because certain nutrients work closely with methionine such as Vitamins B2, B6, B12, folate &amp; zinc. Therefore deficiency symptoms of these nutrients should be considered as part of a possible methionine imbalance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Symptoms and Health Risks</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Impaired methionine metabolism can lead to a range of health problems. Elevated homocysteine levels are a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, increasing the likelihood of heart attack and stroke. Skeletal abnormalities and cognitive decline are also associated with high homocysteine levels. Additionally, impaired methylation capacity has been linked to autoimmune and neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, dementia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders. Recognizing and addressing these symptoms early can help mitigate the associated health risks.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">The DNA PCR Stool Test</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our faecal PCR test detects parasite and bacterial DNA, making it a more accurate technique than a standard Micro, Culture and Sensitivity (MC&amp;S) that would normally be requested.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The faecal multiplex RT-PCR profile is capable of rapid, specific and sensitive detection of the bacterial and parasitic pathogens most commonly responsible for causing infectious gastroenteritis that may otherwise go undetected by traditional microbiological techniques.  PCR is based on molecular screening of individual parasites rather than detection of parasites based on examination of stool under a microscope.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When diagnosing infectious gastroenteritis, conventional diagnostic methods such as faecal microscopy, culture, and sensitivities (and even biochemical tests and ELISA) can be laborious, expensive and insensitive. Additionally, although infection with multiple pathogens is common, existing diagnostic methods are typically ordered and performed for individual pathogens, such that these individual assays may routinely miss the diversity of infecting organisms.</p>

P-5-P vitamin B6 provides 25 mg of vitamin B6 in the active coenzyme form, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, in each easy-to-swallow vegetarian capsule. Vitamin B6 as P-5-P is important as a coenzyme for the normal metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids.* It is also involved in healthy cognitive development, immune health and homocysteine conversion.*
<div class=""box-collateral box-description"">
<div class=""std"">P-5-P or pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is known as the “active” or “coenzyme” form of vitamin B6. This is because the P-5-P form of B6 is directly used in B6-dependent enzyme functions within the body. In fact, vitamin B6 and P-5-P are needed for more than 100 enzymes – mostly related to protein metabolism.In a typical diet, B6 can be found in potatoes, poultry, fortified grains and cereals, salmon and avocados. However, many plant sources contain a less bioavailable form of B6 – pyridoxine glucoside. This form is more difficult to absorb and utilize than the forms found in meat, fish, poultry or supplements. Especially for those who eat a mostly vegan or vegetarian diet, B6 supplementation can be very important.</div>

"Aldosterone/Renin- Blood EDTA Test",aldosteronerenin-blood-edta-test,,1312,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Aldosterone and renin tests are generally ordered together to evaluate whether the adrenal glands are producing appropriate amounts of aldosterone and to distinguish between the potential causes of excess or deficiency.

This profile is most useful in testing for primary aldosteronism, also known as Conn syndrome, which causes high blood pressure. It is known that both aldosterone and renin levels are highest in the morning and vary throughout the day. They are affected by the body’s position, by stress, and by a variety of prescribed medications.

Your healthcare practitioner will request for this profile when someone has high blood pressure, especially if the person also has a low potassium reading. Primary aldosteronism is a potentially curable form of hypertension, so it is important to detect and treat it properly.
<h3>How to take the Aldosterone and Renin test</h3>
The aldosterone and renin test can be done right near your home or office.  Testing for Aldosterone and renin imbalances is really important due to it’s ability to prevent many serious health problems, the test includes:
<ul>
 	<li>An authorized blood specimen order form that you take to your local accredited pathology for collection of your blood (<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/pathology-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Find a pathology near you here</strong></a>).</li>
 	<li>A blood specimen test kit for the pathology to use to collect your blood sample</li>
 	<li>Complete instructions for taking the test for you and the pathology</li>

"Estrogen Dominance Test",estrogen-dominance-test,,1314,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Estrogen has positive effects on the cardiovascular system, bones, brain, skin as well as reproductive organs. The issues experienced at menopause such as memory loss, osteoporosis and vaginal dryness validates the importance of maintaining optimal estrogen levels. However, if you have too much estrogen in the body called estrogen dominance, it may increase the risk of hormone-related cancers such as endometrial, prostate and breast cancer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The view that all estrogens are ‘bad’ and cause cancer is a simplistic one. Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are metabolised into at least 14 different species. These breakdown products and have their own specific biological actions; some have the stimulatory properties of estradiol whilst others are weak and antagonistic to other estrogen molecules. An imbalance of the stimulatory versus weak estrogen metabolites have been observed to be associated with many different health disorders. Whilst high levels of the 16α-hydroxyestrone stimulatory estrogen raise cancer risk, lower levels are associated with osteoporosis. In contrast, if the weak estrogens are high they protect against cancer but inhibit bone growth. Therefore the estrogen metabolites are not inactive excretion products but powerful molecules in their own right and should be monitored.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">The Estrogen Test</h3>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thyroid abnormalities has become a quiet epidemic worldwide. The thyroid has just one job, however, it is one of the most important jobs for the body to function properly. The thyroid makes hormones that regulate the energy level, growth, and reproduction of every cell of your body. That means your brain, heart, lungs, liver, skin, tissues and other body parts depend on your thyroid to stay “powered up” and active, and to remain healthy by generating new cells to replace old ones.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The thyroid profile extensive is a hormone blood test designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of thyroid hormone metabolism. It includes central thyroid gland regulation and activity, thyroid production and secretion, peripheral thyroid conversion, and thyroid autoimmunity. The Extensive thyroid panel allows the practitioner to pinpoint common imbalances that may be causing chronic illnesses. The comprehensive panel measures levels of TSH, free T4, free T3, reverse T3, anti-TG antibodies, and anti-TPO antibodies to assess central and peripheral thyroid function, as well as thyroid auto-immunity.</p>

<h3>About the thyroid</h3>
Thyroid hormones are well known for their role in basal metabolic rate; however, they affect development and growth. The thyroid hormones interact with receptors found in the nucleus of every cell of the body and this interaction leads to the turning on and off of many genes and ultimately to the modification of many bodily functions. Therefore, it is understandable that abnormalities in the level of thyroid hormones can lead to a diverse array of symptoms involving the heart, brain, skin and reproductive systems.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Riboflavin by Seeking Health provides 400 mg of riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, per vegetarian capsule.</strong> Riboflavin is important for healthy growth and development and normal red blood cell production. It also assists in the process of releasing energy from carbohydrates. Riboflavin is a water-soluble B vitamin that must be replenished by dietary sources daily in order to maintain adequate levels to support normal function and health. Coenzyme forms of riboflavin are required for conversion of tryptophan to niacin and of B6 to its coenzyme form (P-5-P). Riboflavin may help support healthy mitochondrial function. It also may help to maintain healthy homocysteine levels. Riboflavin can be found in foods such as milk, meat, eggs, nuts, enriched flour, and green vegetables. Although deficiency is not common in the United States, it may be necessary for certain individuals to use supplements to obtain adequate daily intake of this important nutrient.*</p>

"Niacin Lozenge 50mg",niacin-lozenge-50mg,,1361,"<strong>Niacin Lozenges by Seeking Health provide 50 mg of niacin, also known as vitamin B3, a nutrient that is naturally produced in the body and is found in many of the foods we eat.</strong> Niacin may help support healthy circulation, healthy carbohydrate and fat metabolism, and healthy skin. Because the body cannot store niacin, it requires adequate intake of this important vitamin every day.*

Niacin may support normal mood regulation by relieving any symptoms that could be related to a deficiency of this important vitamin. One of the building blocks of serotonin is the amino acid tryptophan, and one of the building blocks of tryptophan is niacin. Tryptophan also helps maintain healthy levels of niacin within the body. If tryptophan is divided between serotonin production and niacin production, serotonin production may be reduced when niacin levels are inadequate. Supplemental niacin and tryptophan can be beneficial for healthy moods.*

Niacin is important for proper functioning of all cells, including the cells of the brain and nervous system. Niacin has the well-known effect of causing vasodilation, often called the niacin “flush,” which is an opening of small blood vessels (capillaries) for increased blood flow. These are the blood vessels which are of most value in reaching fatty tissues. Healthy blood flow is important for allowing toxins stored in these fatty tissues to be removed into the bloodstream, and processed out of the body. Niacin may also support healthy skin by promoting normal moisture retention, elasticity and tone. Niacin may also support healthy cartilage.*

<h2>Warnings</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Children and pregnant or lactating women should consult their healthcare practitioner prior to use. Do not use if tamper seal is damaged. Consult with a healthcare professional before use if you are using antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure medications, alpha-inhibitors or other medications. Niacin may cause a ""flush"" feeling including tingling, feeling warm, blushing or turning red (usually on the face, ears, neck, or chest). This reaction is more common for individuals who have not used niacin-containing supplements before, or for those who are sensitive to niacin. It usually subsides in a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the individual. You can reduce your likelihood of experiencing that reaction by eating a meal before or very shortly after taking a supplement containing niacin, drinking plenty of water, and making sure that your dose is appropriate. It may be best to start out with only a portion of a serving and gradually work your way up to your desired dose, allowing your system to acclimate to the niacin. We recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional for help determining the best dose of niacin for your individual needs, and that you talk with your practitioner about any side-effects your experience while using niacin.</p>",,publish,,0,"2016-10-31 12:44:53",1,closed,NIACIN-100-LOZ,,,no,no,0,35.00,,.048,6,6,10,,visible,outofstock,no,,,yes,none,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,"https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Niacin-lozenge-seeking-health.jpg ! alt : niacin-lozenge-seeking-health ! title : niacin-lozenge-seeking-health ! desc :  ! caption :  | https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Niacin-lozenge-label-seeking-health.jpg ! alt :  ! title : niacin-lozenge-label-seeking-health ! desc :  ! caption : ",,https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/niacin-lozenge-50mg/,7,,,,,,,,,3,30,,,"Seeking Health",,simple,outofstock,"Seeking Health|Vitamins","Niacin|Niacin Lozenge|Seeking Health",

<b>Percy's Powder</b> Percy's Powder is the original and legendary formulation based on 60 years of Percy Weston's own research into the cause of cancer and how to treat it.
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a style=""color: #0000ff;"" href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Perceys-Powder-Flyer.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">&gt;Click here to read the Percy Powder Flyer&lt;</a></span></h4>
Percy's Powder is best taken in conjunction with a diet containing vitamin B12 and other essential vitamins.  It is highly recommended that a <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product-category/hair-mineral-analysis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hair mineral analysis</a> be used to confirm mineral balances.

Percy's Powder is a blood tonic and helps maintain normal blood. It is a valuable source of iron and zinc.

The mineral salts in Percy’s Powder® readily dissolves in water (or fruit juice) to supply the body with a means of checking the build-up of acids and phosphate, and flushing them out in the urine. (Acid build-up in the tissues may cause infection and chronic disease.)

The minerals in Percy’s Powder® are also involved in regulating water balance, in making new blood, in the operation of muscles and nerves, in the movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide, in transporting cell nutrients and regulating cell nutrition, in making enzymes involved in digestion, energy production and protein building, and in activating hormones that regulate many body processes.

Percy’s mineral salts are sulphates (unlike most others ). This means each one dissociates in water into ions, groups of atoms that the body can use immediately wherever they are needed, Sulphates disinfect the blood, resist bacteria, and detoxifies.
<h3><b>Why take Percy’s Powder®?</b></h3>
Because modern diets, while containing these minerals, do not have enough of them to balance the abundant acid minerals coming from the soils conditioned by chemical fertilisers and processed additives.

<b>Percy's Powder Ingredients</b>
Each sachet contains:
<ul>
 	<li>MAGNESIUM (as sulphate) 78.1mg</li>
 	<li>POTASSIUM (as sulphate) 131mg</li>
 	<li>IRON (as sulphate) 9.1mg</li>
 	<li>ZINC (as sulphate) 10.2mg</li>
 	<li>MANGANESE (as sulphate) 9.1mg</li>
</ul>
<b>Dosage</b>
(Adults and children over 12 years). Take one sachet of percy's powder daily in a glass of water. Stir well. Best taken with the juice of half a lemon, with grapefruit, or in grape or apple juice. May also be taken in tea.

Until his recent death at more than 100 years old, Percy Weston had been a farmer for much of the past century in the beautiful Ovens Valley of south-eastern Australia where his grand-parents settled during the goldrush. The family homestead, Riltrin, which he built himself, has views of Mount Buffalo and the Victorian alps. This haven of horticulture, with extensive nut grove, green orchards, vegetable garden and paddocks of grazing sheep, has its own spring-water supply. At one time he grew tobacco in the valley.

A scholarship Percy Weston won as a boy gave him a grounding in the sciences which would have led to a medical career had his father not suffered hardship at the hands of daring cattle thieves. On the farm our author found himself having to study nature closely and follow the practices of his pioneering parents in order to keep his crops, livestock and family healthy.

<h2>Testing for S.I.B.O</h2>
This simple, non-invasive home breath test detects bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, a common condition that often underlies chronic symptoms of maldigestion and malabsorption, including bloating, gas, diarrhoea, irregularity, and abdominal pain.

Bacterial concentrations in the small intestine are normally kept to a minimum. When excessive, the delicate mucosal lining is disrupted, including the microvilli that facilitate absorption. As a result, bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine (BOSI) can inhibit nutrient absorption and lead to the following serious health problems.

Ammonia testing measures the amount of ammonia in the blood. Most ammonia in the body forms when protein is broken down by bacteria in the intestines. The liver’s role is to normally convert ammonia into urea, which is then eliminated and excreted in urine.

However, a good indication of liver dysfunction is when Ammonia levels in the blood rise due to the liver not being able to convert ammonia to urea. This may be caused by cirrhosis or severe hepatitis.

For this test, a blood sample is taken and sent urgently for analyses.

Glutathione is your body's major antioxidant system.  Glutathione is considered to be the most important antioxidant produced by the body because of the many ways that this powerful chemical works to keep you healthy and even prevents ageing.

Testing your glutathione levels is a great way to make sure that your body is making enough glutathione.  The Glutathione GSH &amp; GSSG home test is a great way to make sure your body is producing enough glutathione and that it isn't being broken down too fast which are the two most important factors.
<h3>Low glutahione levels can cause the following problems...</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>An increase in oxidative stress on the body (aging and disease)</li>
 	<li>Weakens the immune system</li>
 	<li>Possible <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/homocysteine-levels-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">imbalances in homocysteine levels</a></li>
 	<li>Accumulation of toxins including heavy metals</li>
 	<li>Inability to properly repair DNA</li>
 	<li>Leads to disease states</li>
 	<li>Reduced ability to properly detoxify</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms of glutathione deficiency</h3>
The symptoms of glutathione deficiency can be hard to detect, this is because glutathione does so many different jobs at a very deep level.  Because glutathione is a major antioxidant and reduced ability to produce glutathione causes oxadative stress, the whole body can develop problems and this leads to many hundreds of different symptoms.  The human body is made up of cells and these cells all need to be protected by glutathione to remain in a healthy state, when glutathione is deficient this directly reduces the health of the body at a cellular level and can even cause cell deaths, too many of these ""cell deaths"" means disease and serious risks to your health.
<h3>The Glutathione Test</h3>
The Glutathione GSH &amp; GSSG home test can be done right near your home or office.  The test covers the amount of glutathione reduced (GSH) &amp; gluathione oxidised (GSSG).  Testing for glutathione imbalances is really important due to it’s ability to prevent many serious health problems, the test includes:

Nagalase is a protein made by all cancer cells and viruses. This test is an ideal test for monitoring the effect of therapy of cancer and certain viral infections, including HIV &amp; Autism.

The test measures the activity of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (nagalase) in blood.  Nagalase is an extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme that is (increased) secreted by cancerous cells in the process of tumour invasion. Nagalase causes immunodeficiency, preventing the immune system from doing its job. Without an active immune system, cancer and viral infections can grow unchecked.

Many people also carry genetic mutations called <a href=""https://mthfrgenehealth.com/fut2-gene-mutations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">FUT2</a> which limit their ability to make an important cancer killing substance called GcMAF.  The Nagalase test can help to identify those that may be vulnerable to cancer as a result of having these genes mutations.

As an extremely sensitive marker for all cancers and certain viruses, Nagalase testing provides a powerful tool for early detection and treatment.

<ul>
 	<li>May help support cellular health and normal cell proliferation</li>
 	<li>May help support dental health</li>
 	<li>May help support fat and carbohydrate metabolism</li>
 	<li>May help support healthy iron utilization</li>
</ul>
<strong>Molybdenum 500 provides 500 mcg of molybdenum (as molybdenum glycinate chelate) in each easy-to-swallow vegetarian capsule.</strong> Molybdenum is an essential trace mineral. In the human body, molybdenum is found in the bones, liver, and kidneys. Molybdenum plays a role in a number of important bio-chemical processes, like waste processing in the kidneys, development of the nervous system, and the activation of enzymes that are involved in breaking down food to produce energy.* Molybdenum may also help support normal metabolism of fats and carbohydrates.* It is necessary for maintain normal iron levels and utilization in the body due to its involvement in the enzymatic process that mobilizes iron form the liver reserves.*

Most people get enough molybdenum if they eat foods from nutrient-rich soil, as only a small amount of it is needed. Deficiency rarely happens, except for example, where there is a genetic problem that prevents the body from absorbing molybdenum from food, or in cases of prolonged intravenous feeding. While deficiency is rare, those whose diets rely mainly on processed or refined foods might not be getting enough molybdenum for optimal health.* High sulfur intake can also reduce molybdenum levels.*
<h3>Suggested Use</h3>
Take 1 capsule daily with or without food, or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.
<h3>Warnings</h3>
Children and pregnant or lactating women should consult their healthcare practitioner prior to use. Do not use if tamper seal is damaged.

"Reverse T3 Test",reverse-t3-test,,1976,"Do you suspect a thyroid problem but testing shows ""normal"".  It may be a reverse T3 problem and this simple test can tell you the truth about what is really going on with your thyroid.

<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>
<h3>What is Reverse T3?</h3>
Reverse T3 (RT3) levels can increase when peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3 is impaired.  Peripheral thyroid imbalances may arise from nutrient deficiencies, heavy metal exposure, adrenal stress, enzyme deficiencies, and chronic illnesses.

Reverse T3 acts as a storage protein for three molecules of iodine within tissues and the circulation.  T3 and RT3 are de-iodinated to T2, releasing one of its iodine molecules. These iodine molecules are then utilised by a variety of tissues including breast, prostate, ovaries, salivary glands, CNS, stomach, kidneys and placenta.

kiran Krishnan(Microbiome labs): As many of you know health starts with the gut, probiotics are beneficial bacteria but they have to be live organisms that are commensal to the gut, they live within the digestive tract. The problem is that most probiotics today never make it through the digestive tract alive and are thereby not functional probiotics.  The other aspect of a true probiotic is its ability to colonize the gut, reside within the natural flora and conduct metabolic functions that are beneficial to the gut and the human host.

A third aspect of a probiotic is that it has to be able to fit within the natural microbiome and influence the microbiome to allow for the natural growth of your own microbiome species that you were born with.

<h3>Why Megasporebiotic works</h3>
Megasporebiotic is a probiotic, it is a unique all spore formula that maintains efficacy during antibiotic therapy, while most probiotic strains that cannot survive digestion the advanced probiotic is proven to survive inside the large intestine. Winning over probiotic strains that cannot survive means that the process of reseeding with probiotic strains in the intestine effectively assisting to rebuild optimal microbiome (good gut bacteria).

The spore biotic blend aims to recondition, often dormant spores can change the condition of the gut instead of reseeding however in the gut this unique probiotic can restore function and overall immunity of the gastrointestinal tract once inside the
<h3>Probiotic and built in Antioxidants</h3>
With a blend of 5 bacillus spores that are naturally designed to survive digestion. The reason for their inherent survivability in the human gastrointestinal tract that allows them to remain intact in digestion comes from their bi-phasic life cycle. This means that the Bacillus spores can transition interchangeably from their dormant form to their active form, depending on the environment.

In its dormant spore form, the probiotic blend of 5 Bacillus will surround itself with an endospore, which is a tough, natural outer shell that protects it from light, heat, pressure, acid, lack of oxygen, and other environmental factors. This key feature is what allows probiotics to survive easily through digestion without the need for enteric-coated capsules or refrigeration.

Once it reaches the intestines, the advanced probiotic can increase microbial diversity by changing the pH, crowding out unwanted pathogens, and increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids. Due to its inherent survivability and lasting health benefits, MegaSporeBiotic™ has become a revolutionary tool in Total Gut

The findings of these oligosaccharide studies are quite impressive:
<ul>
 	<li>FOS increased populations of A. mucin by 8,000% in 5 weeks</li>
 	<li>FOS increased populations of F. prau by 100% in 4 weeks</li>
 	<li>GOS increased populations of Bifido by 10% in 6 weeks</li>
 	<li>XOS increased populations of Bifido by 9% in 8 weeks</li>
</ul>
Increasing populations of these protective bacteria is an integral part of reinforcing a healthy microbiome. Studies have shown that a more diverse  microbiome is associated with a stronger immune system and a decreased risk for chronic illness. Nourish the powerful ecosystem in your gut with MegaPreBiotic™ today!
<h3>Aren’t all prebiotics the same?</h3>
Prebiotics are essentially dietary fibers that cannot be digested or absorbed by the human digestive tract but instead feed the bacteria living in your gut. The problem is that most prebiotics on the market are not selective.  This means that they can feed both harmful and beneficial gut bacteria, which can often exacerbate digestive issues.

MegaPre™ contains medium-chain carbohydrates, known as oligosaccharides, that cannot be digested by humans but instead target keystone species known as secondary degraders.  Primary degraders feed on the bulkier fibers like cellulose, resistant starches, and inulin and then convert them into intermediate products like acetate, lactate, and oligosaccharides that can then feed the butyrate-producing secondary degraders.

These complex fibers are important because they can feed beneficial bacteria, but they can also be utilized by harmful bacteria. For this reason, we decided to skip the first step and provide the gut microbiome with the intermediate byproducts that it needs to produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate.

The oligosaccharides used in MegaPre™ have been clinically shown to significantly increase keystone species like Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Bifidobacteria - all of which are very important for healthy metabolism, intestinal barrier function, and body composition.
<h3>MegaPre &amp; Immunity</h3>
Research shows that the ingredients in MegaPre™ can help support a strong immune system through the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can subsequently stimulate intestinal cells to produce a protective compound known as β-defensin that can help to keep the gut microbiome in balance.

One study found that consuming Livaux® gold kiwifruit concentrate, found in MegaSporeBiotic™, could modulate the immune system by increasing the production of T-cells and immunoglobulins, such as IgG, which can help support a balanced gut microbiome.  Another study conducted on the effects of B-GOS on immune function in elderly adults found that the lactose-derived B-GOS significantly increased phagocytosis and natural killer cell activity, two components which are essential for a strong immune system.
<h3>Key Functions of Megpre</h3>
• Diversify the microbiome
• Support keystone species
• Support immunity

Haemochromatosis is the most common genetic disorder, affecting about one in every 200 Australians of European origin. It causes the body to absorb too much iron resulting in iron overload.

The excess iron is stored in your organs, especially the liver, heart and pancreas. There are other causes of iron overload including frequent blood transfusions for the treatment of thalassaemia and some haemolytic diseases.

Iron is absorbed from the diet through the small intestine and the amount absorbed is determined by the body’s needs. People with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) absorb more iron than their body needs. As the body does not have a way to increase excretion of the excess iron there is a progressive build-up of the excess iron in tissues and organs. The symptoms of hereditary haemochromatosis occur in adulthood.
<h3>Common conditions associated with Haemochromatosis</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Fatigue</li>
 	<li>Joint pain</li>
 	<li>Arthritis</li>
 	<li>Diabetes</li>
 	<li>Liver cirrhosis</li>
 	<li>Anxiety</li>
 	<li>Loss of libido</li>
 	<li>Heart failure</li>

<h3>What is tested?</h3>
The test looks for the following indicators:

<strong>Hereditary Haemochromatosis gene mutations HFE C282Y &amp; H63D</strong>
<h3>How To Take The Haemochromatosis Test</h3>

"Apolipoprotein E (APO-E) Saliva Test Kit",apolipoprotein-e-apo-e-saliva-test-kit,,2093,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Apolipoprotein E short for APO-E is produced primarily in the liver and brain which has two primary distinct roles:
<ol>
 	<li>The transport of lipids from where they are made or absorbed to the tissues where they are stored.</li>
 	<li>The transport of cholesterol and other lipids from the body’s organs to the liver for excretion.</li>
</ol>
The APOE gene exists in three different forms (alleles) – e2, e3, and e4 – with e3 being the most common allele, found in 60 per cent of the general population. Everyone inherits two APOE genes, one from each parent that is some combination of these three forms.

Recent studies have shown that the APO E gene test is a useful diagnostic test to help confirm a diagnosis of Type III hyperlipoproteinaemia and a diagnosis of late onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a symptomatic adult.

<strong>Why get tested?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>If you have elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels that do not respond to lifestyle changes.</li>
 	<li>If you suspect Alzheimer’s disease</li>
 	<li>If you have a family history of heart disease</li>

Iodine is the classic therapy for hypothyroidism as it is needed by the thyroid gland to synthesize thyroid hormones.

Selenium is another essential mineral needed for proper thyroid functioning. The thyroid gland contains more selenium than other body parts and during selenium deficiency, the body meets the selenium needs of the thyroid even before it sends selenium to the brain.

Amino acids such as tyrosine is a critical amino acid for the building block of all proteins in the body including hormones such as T3 and T4.

Scientists have determined that your secretor status - secretor or non-secretor - plays a profound role in your health. Knowing your secretor type empowers you to further refine your Blood Type Diet and take strategic control of your own wellness and lifestyle choices.

The term ‘secretor’ or ‘non-secretor’ refers to the ability of an individual to secrete ABO blood group antigens in bodily fluids such as saliva, sweat, tears, serum and the gastrointestinal mucus secretions. The function of ABO antigens remain an enigma, however it has recently been suggested that blood groups and secretor status are part of innate immunity against infectious disease. Non-secretors have an increased risk for urinary tract infections, candida, autoimmune disorders, bacterial infections, HIV virus, Novo virus and heart disease.

A person who is a ‘secretor’ will secrete antigens according to their blood group, i.e. a group O individual will secrete H antigen, a group A individual will secrete A and H antigens etc. Obviously a ‘non-secretor’ or weak secretor will have no or little antigen present in their bodily fluids.

A majority of Caucasians (80%) are secretors. Although non-secretor status seems to be common among Chinese, Japanese, Polynesians, Australian aborigines and African-Americans.

Decreased antigens may affect bacterial attachment and persistence on mucosal epithelia. Consistent with this theory is the observation that non-secretors have an increased risk for urinary tract infections, candida and dental cavities. Furthermore, non-secretors have changes in their immune system function and have higher rates of autoimmune disorders. Non-secretor status is also associated with increased levels of clotting factors and heart disease. By determining secretor status, a predisposition to certain conditions can be assessed and preventative therapies can be introduced.

<h3>Health Digestion</h3>
You may have heard that “you are what you eat,” but a more accurate phrase would be that “you are what you digest and absorb.” Digestion begins in the mouth with digestive enzymes present in saliva. Your body then relies on you to chew your food into small pieces before sending it through your stomach acid for further breakdown. Once your food passes through the stomach, the final step of digestion relies almost entirely upon the digestive enzymes from your pancreas. Bacillus subtilis helps to maintain healthy digestion by increasing the production of digestive enzymes in the gut, including amylase, protease, lipase, and more.
<h3>Survivability</h3>
Bacillus subtilis is a very robust probiotic that forms an outer protective shell, known as an endospore. This impenetrable coating protects the bacterium from harsh environments, including heat, acid, pressure, light, and lack of oxygen. The rugged nature of Bacillus subtilis makes it the perfect probiotic to survive manufacturing, packaging, shipping, and ultimately digestion. In fact, this species is so resilient that researchers at California Polytechnic State University reported reviving Bacillus spores from the gut of a 25-million-year-old bee that was fossilized in amber.

<h5>MegaMucosa is the complete mucosal support supplement of its kind, formulated to REBUILD a healthy mucosal barrier.</h5>

MegaMucosa also contains dairy-free immunoglobulins shown to support a healthy immune response in the mucosa and a state-of-the-art flavobiotic clinically shown to support microbial diversity and alleviate barrier dysfunction, otherwise known as leaky gut.

The mucosal system is a very important part of the human immune system. Not many people think of mucus as being protective, but it is the main interface between the human body and the outside world. <strong>The mucosal system contains 150 times more surface area than skin, which makes it one of the most important immune barriers.</strong> The health of the mucosa determines how the body interacts with antigens; therefore, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa can dictate overall immune function.

kiran Krishnan(Microbiome labs): ""Megamucosa it's a mucosa support formula, now when you look at the intestinal lining where a lot of disease starts, it happens in the breakdown of the mucosa, so the mucosa is an actual physical barrier that separates the outside world which is the lumen of the intestines from the inside world which is when things are allowed to get passed the intestinal limning and enter the circulation"".

""<strong>That mucosal barrier is the defense system and also the immune sampling for everything that is entering the body,</strong> now most people don't know this that the mucosal system of the body has over 150 more time the surface area than the dermal system (the skin), we always think of our dermal system (our skin) as our biggest area but it is in fact the mucosal system"".
<h5>""And everything starts in the mucosal system when it comes to inflammatory breakdown in response to the environment that includes environmental toxins, food, bacteria, viruses and so on"".</h5>
&nbsp;

""So it becomes paramount to make sure we are dealing with or have a healthy mucosal layer, now the mucosal layer is made up from something called glycoprotien which is a mix between sugar and amino acid which is the building block of the mucosa"".
<h5>""Even though we can use probiotics and prebiotics to stimulate the rebuilding of the mucosa...</h5>
&nbsp;

if you don't provide the building blocks your body won't be able to rebuild your mucosa"".

""So one of the main components of the megamucosa is that we have added these essential amino acids, there are 4 essential amino acids that go into the product to act as the building blocks, a study has showed that <strong>with the addition of those amino acids when you damaged the mucosal lining it increases the growth of the mucosal lining the repair of the mucosal lining by 95%</strong> compared to not providing those specific amino acids"".

""Now, on top of that <strong>you need to modulate the immune response</strong> and that's where we have selected a very well studied bovine IgG, this is a immunoglobulin specifically the IgG version that studies show helps reduce inflammation in the intestinal lining, it helps modulate the immune response to bacteria, viruses, toxins, food particles which allows for the minimizing of the damage to the mucosa which then allows the mucosa to regenerate and rebuild"".

""So megamucosa becomes a very very essential part of total gut restoration because you can fix the microbiome, you can fix the leakiness of the gut but if you don't have an effective mucosal layer you are not going to solve the problem.""

The dairy-free immunoglobulin concentrate supports healthy digestion, neutralizes environmental toxins, and <strong>helps to REBUILD protective intestinal barriers.</strong> These IgG antibodies can reduce the damage of metabolic endotoxemia and neutralize LPS, an endotoxin that triggers mucosal activation.

There are four key amino acids that play an important role in the production of intestinal mucosa include: L-proline, L-serine, L-cysteine, and L-threonine. These four amino acids have been shown to increase mucin2 production and stimulate mucin synthesis in the colon, resulting in a thicker and healthier mucosal barrier.

MicrobiomeX® is a natural citrus extract rich in polyphenols that supports digestive health and immunity by increasing microbial diversity in the gut and maintaining healthy gut barrier function. A clinical study using 500mg of citrus fruit extract found a significant increase in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition, suggesting that these polyphenols may help modulate the microbial composition in the gut.
<h3>Why rebuild your intestinal barrier?</h3>
One of the biggest health risks of today is <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><strong><a style=""color: #0000ff;"" href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/auto-immune-disease/how-to-check-for-leaky-gut-syndrome/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">intestinal permeability and or leaky gut syndrome</a></strong></span>.  Leaky gut syndrome is a condition where your intestinal tract becomes leaky, in other words the intestinal wall becomes weak allowing toxins, waste products and undigested foods to pass through the intestinal wall and into your blood stream which causes a great deal of distress to your body, your organs, unsets your immune system and your health leading to serious diseases including most autoimmune diseases.
<h5>The truth is without a healthy intestinal track you can lose your ability to properly absorb essential nutrients that defend against death related diseases.</h5>
&nbsp;

The biggest problem with increase intestinal permeability is that once it starts it causes a chain reaction of events that make it hard the body to repair the problem.  Once the lining of the intestinal wall becomes damaged and allows toxic substances to pass through to the blood stream other organs such as the liver, kidney’s and immune system are now under great pressure to attempt to clean up the mess, this causes a vicious cycle especially with the liver and immune system.
<h3 class=""product_title"">Causes of leaky gut &amp; Intestinal permeability</h3>
<p class=""product_title"">So what causes a leaky gut you may wonder, well there is no one answer, intestinal permeability is one the most important parts of not only digestion but also of nutrition, increased permeability of the intestine leads to reduced intake of essential nutrients, this happens because essential nutrients are not digested properly making the nutrients unusable, so when you have leaky gut you will also have nutritional deficiencies.  When the permeability becomes increased that’s when the problems start.  We know that leaky gut is a result of many contributing factors here are just some of the more common causes:</p>

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is a condition where a patient may have a normal level of mast cells present, but these cells may be over-responsive or overreact to the body.  Symptoms are usually related to the excess and episodic release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. A common presentation is recurrent anaphylaxis where no trigger or cause can be identified. It is often a challenging condition to detect because the inflammatory mediators may only be released during an episode, then return to normal levels. For example, if the patient is amidst a flare-up they may or may not have an elevated serum tryptase level.

<strong>The MCAS Profile – 3409 basic profile </strong>includes some of the basic inflammatory mediators that may be released in Mast Cell Activation syndrome. For example, these include Tryptase, Chromogranin A, Whole Blood Histamine. Tryptase is a serine protease that is released during mast cell degranulation. Chromogranin A is another inflammatory mediator used to identify MCAS.

Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of mold that have adverse effects of your health. These toxins are produced by some species of mold. These mycotoxins are some of <strong>the most toxic substances in existence</strong> and cause a wide range of health conditions. When people are around toxic mold they are usually exposed to airborne mycotoxins by breathing them in. These mycotoxins end up in the lungs and cause breathing problems and other severe symptoms.

This urine test is a Mycotoxin Panel which are unique profiles for identifying the existence of Mycotoxins in the body. The reporting format will identify whether the mycotoxin is <strong>‘PRESENT’</strong> or <strong>‘NON-PRESENT’</strong>

<strong>Tricothecenes:</strong> Are mycotoxins produced by a number of different fungi such as Stachybotrys and Fusarium. Their mechanism of action is the inhibition of protein synthesis, therefore they are known to kill cells and are extremely dangerous. It is known that when Stachybotrys grows in a mold infested building, the organism produces tricothecene mycotoxins. It is also known that these toxins can get into the air where than can be inhaled.

<strong>Aflatoxins:</strong> Are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus.The organisms that usually produce aflatoxins are Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and can be cancer producing.

<strong>Ochratoxin A:</strong> is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium verrucosumand is one of the most abundant food-contaminating mycotoxins in the world. Human exposure occurs mainly through consumption of improperly stored food products, particularly contaminated grain and pork products, as well as coffee, wine grapes, and dried grapes

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mould illness or Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) is a common but poorly recognized condition because of many debilitating (but not obvious) symptoms including chronic fatigue, generalised pain, headaches, depression, sinusitis, rashes and anxiety. Many of these conditions are caused by exposure to the interior environment of water damaged buildings (WDBs). Chronic fatigue syndrome is often misdiagnosed and can be associated with mould exposure, as studies show a significant percentage of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome test positive for mycotoxins. These organisms grow on household surfaces that have high cellulose content, such as wood, fibreboard, gypsum board, paper, dust and lint. The most common types of mould that are found indoors include: <strong>Cladosporium, Penicillium, Alternaria, Aspergillus and Stachybotrys (black mould).</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mould Biotoxins are shed into the environment of WDBs and are acquired into the body via foods, water, air, or insect bites. They cause inflammatory responses via influencing/affecting signalling pathways in the body, releasing inflammatory cytokines. They aggravate existing lung diseases, and can cause inflammation of the lungs. Chronic illness can arise from persistent exposure to mould toxins, especially in individuals with certain genetic predispositions who struggle to clear these toxins, resulting in widespread inflammation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the general population, biotoxins are removed from the body via the bloodstream through the liver or alternatively broken down by the body’s immune system and excreted out of the body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in patients with a compromised immune system (either genetically or environmentally), biotoxins can remain within the body for lengthy periods of time and exacerbate the above conditions. This susceptible group seem to be unable to clear mould toxins easily and efficiently. Their symptoms though are often vague, since toxins can affect any body organ. For CIRS patients, specific diets like the No-Amylose Diet and blood tests measuring biomarkers such as leptin and VEGF are crucial for understanding and managing their health outcomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since mould toxins cause inflammation through activation of cytokines, there are a number of lab tests which can show the effects of inflammation.</p>

<h3>What is Mould Illness?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mould illness, also known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), is a condition that occurs when the body’s immune system overreacts to mould exposure. This overreaction can lead to a myriad of symptoms, including chronic fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, and respiratory issues. Mould illness is often triggered by exposure to mould in water-damaged buildings, where species like Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Stachybotrys thrive. When these moulds release spores, mycotoxins, and biotoxins into the air, they can be inhaled or come into contact with the skin, prompting an immune response that can become chronic and debilitating.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These tests help health practitioners pinpoint the specific mould toxins affecting the patient and determine the extent of immune system dysfunction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Diagnosing Mould Exposure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diagnosing mould exposure can be a complex process, as the symptoms often mimic those of other conditions. However, several tests and methods can help pinpoint mould exposure and its effects on the body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most common diagnostic tools is blood tests. These tests can measure the levels of mould toxins in the blood and assess the body’s immune response to mould exposure. Key blood tests include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mycotoxin Testing</strong>: This test measures the levels of mould toxins present in the blood, providing direct evidence of exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immune System Testing</strong>: This test evaluates the body’s immune response to mould exposure, identifying any abnormalities or heightened activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflammatory Cytokine Testing</strong>: This test measures the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the blood, which can indicate an ongoing inflammatory response due to mould exposure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another valuable diagnostic method is Organic Acids Testing (OAT). OAT is a urine test that measures the levels of organic acids, which are byproducts of mould exposure. Elevated levels of these acids can signal mould exposure and help guide treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to these tests, health practitioners may use other diagnostic tools, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Examination</strong>: A thorough physical exam can reveal symptoms like skin rashes or respiratory issues that may be linked to mould exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medical History</strong>: Reviewing a patient’s medical history can uncover previous mould exposure or sensitivities that might contribute to current symptoms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental Testing</strong>: Testing the home or workplace for mould can identify potential sources of exposure, aiding in diagnosis and prevention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By combining these diagnostic methods, health practitioners can accurately diagnose mould exposure and develop effective treatment plans tailored to each patient’s needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>The Role of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in Mould Exposure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a critical protein involved in the body’s response to mould exposure. VEGF regulates blood vessel growth and permeability, playing a significant role in the inflammatory response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the body encounters mould toxins, it releases VEGF to manage the resulting inflammation. However, this can lead to increased blood vessel permeability, allowing mould toxins to enter the bloodstream and exacerbate inflammation. Elevated VEGF levels are often found in individuals with mould exposure and are closely linked to Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). This condition is characterized by chronic inflammation and a range of symptoms, including chronic fatigue, muscle cramps, and respiratory issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VEGF is not only relevant in mould exposure but also in other conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. In these conditions, elevated VEGF levels contribute to chronic inflammation, highlighting the protein’s role in various inflammatory diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health practitioners may use VEGF testing as part of a comprehensive diagnostic approach to mould exposure. By measuring VEGF levels, they can gain insights into the extent of inflammation and tailor treatment plans accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In managing mould exposure, dietary adjustments such as adopting a gluten-free diet can help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Additionally, maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is crucial, as the GI tract plays a vital role in immune system function and overall health. By addressing both dietary and environmental factors, patients can achieve better health outcomes and manage the effects of mould exposure more effectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Treatment for Mould Illness</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treating mould illness requires a multifaceted approach, combining medication, dietary adjustments, and lifestyle changes. Common treatments include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Toxin binders like cholestyramine or Welchol to help remove mould toxins from the body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dietary changes, such as adopting a gluten-free diet, to reduce inflammation and support healing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifestyle modifications, including avoiding further mould exposure and managing stress, to alleviate symptoms and promote recovery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By addressing both the physical and environmental factors, patients can achieve significant improvements in their health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->

Mould Biotoxins are shed into the environment of WDBs and are acquired into the body via foods, water, air, or insect bites. They cause inflammatory responses via influencing/affecting signalling pathways in the body, releasing inflammatory cytokines. They aggravate existing lung diseases, and can cause inflammation of the lungs.

In the general population, biotoxins are removed from the body via the bloodstream through the liver or alternatively broken down by the body’s immune system and excreted out of the body.

However, in patients with a compromised immune system (either genetically or environmentally), biotoxins can remain within the body for lengthy periods of time and exacerbate the above conditions.

When an antigen enters the body, it elicits a response from the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system. The adaptive immune response utilizes B and T lymphocytes to find foreign antigens, neutralize them, and eliminate them from the body. B lymphocytes do this by producing antibodies, or immunoglobulins, that can bind to unwanted antigens and remove them from the system.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG), the most abundant healthy gut barrier function antibody in the system, can be found in blood and extracellular fluid, allowing it to control infections in the body.

You may be wondering what causes autoimmune disease and there is no short answer, however you should know that in order to develop an autoimmune disease you must have the genes for it and most people do.  Most autoimmune disorders are the result of faulty genes that also need an external trigger to activate the disorder along with having a <a href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/product/intestinal-permeability-and-leaky-gut-test/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">leaky gut </a>such as inflammation in the gut as a result of too many LPS Toxins which MegIgG helps to neutralize.
<h3>Autoimmune Disease Triggers</h3>
Faulty genes combined with environmental chemicals and leaky gut set the stage for autoimmune disease.  Other factors that also contribute include inflammatory bowel, infections, food intolerance’s &amp; sensitivities, emotional stress, exposure to chemicals, heavy metals, pregnancy and nutritional deficiencies, while many of these problems are common MegIgG helps to neutralize the negative effects of these external conditions right in the gut.

So the bottom line is you need the genes for autoimmune to occur, you need to have leaky gut and you need an environmental trigger to start of the disease process, if MegIgG is present or part of a an overall protocol to solve these issues the odds of continued development of the autoimmune disease is significantly reduced or even stopped and that were the damage can be repaired.
<h3>Genetic Problems &amp; Gut Immunity</h3>
Many people can have genetic mutations that cause them to have lower defenses against certain bacteria leaving them with lower front line immune defenses, MegaIgG2000 by microbiome labs can help increase these defenses assisting in natural immunity while it maintains healthy gut barrier .  Table 1 below gives examples of some leading bacterial problems that MegaIgG2000 can help support.

Skin is the largest organ in the human body. The skin not only acts as a barrier to protect the body from the sun’s ultraviolent radiation, toxic chemicals, and pathogens, but also helps to detect changes in the environment such as temperature and pressure.

Inevitably, constant exposure to environmental (extrinsic) factors and biological (intrinsic) factors contribute to skin aging, most noticeable on the face. Intrinsic aging is based on individual heredity and the natural effects of the passage of time. Individuals’ unique genetic makeup can also influence skin appearance and other skin conditions such as wrinkles, skin allergy and inflammation, skin elasticity, skin oxidation and glycation.

SkinFit DNA test is a unique, physician-ordered genetic test which <strong>analyzes over 70 genetic markers associated with seven categories of skin health.</strong> SkinFit reports on the individuals’ genetic predisposition to:
<ul>
 	<li>Sun-induced skin aging</li>
 	<li>Sensitivity to the sun and UV rays</li>
 	<li>Dry skin and wrinkle development</li>
 	<li>Skin inflammation and allergy</li>

"Pesticides & Insecticides - Organophosphate Test",pesticides-insecticides-organophosphate-test,,2925,"<h3>Are you toxic with pesticides and or insecticides from the environment or food supply?</h3>
The Organophosphate pesticides/insecticides home urine test can tell you if you have toxic levels and help to provide essential information for detoxification of these harmful chemicals.

Organophosphate pesticides/insecticides are nerve agents that inactivate an important enzyme which is essential to nerve function. This can cause neurodevelopment disorders in small children and fetuses. Chronic toxicity can occur as these chemicals are used on food crops, orchards, and food storage centers.

The Organophosphates Profile is a <strong>home urine test</strong> that identifies a persons prolonged exposure to organophosphate pesticides. The Organophosphates Profile uncovers exposure to these pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides to determine if avoidance and detoxification are needed for optimal health. Organophosphates from pesticides can be hazardous to the neurological development of children and babies in the womb, producing lower IQs.
<h3>What are some of the symptoms of pesticides/insecticide toxicity?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Nausea</li>
 	<li>Headache</li>
 	<li>Dizziness</li>
 	<li>Muscle twitching</li>
 	<li>Poor coordination</li>
 	<li>Neurotoxic effects</li>
 	<li>Reproductive (fertility problems male and female)</li>
 	<li>Increase cancer risk</li>
 	<li>Vomiting</li>
 	<li>Diarrhoea</li>

"Phthalates Parabens Xenoestrogens Test",phthalates-parabens-xenoestrogens-test,,2931,"<h3>Are you toxic with plastics?</h3>
Plastics and plastic like products are everywhere and many people are becoming toxic from plastics that contain Phthalates and Parabens .

<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

The Phthalates and Parabens is an important test to assess for patient exposure to phthalates and parabens as it is a far more common health concern than you may realise. Some of us may not even know that on our day to day lives the phthalates and parabens that we are exposed to and the potential impact it may have on our body. Phthalates and parabens are often classified as xenoestrogens, foreign compounds in the body functioning as <strong>endocrine disruptors</strong> by binding specifically to estrogen receptors.
<h3>About the dangers of endocrine disruptors</h3>
Endocrine disruptors such as Phthalates and Parabens can affect your endocrine system, this means it can prevent the proper function of the following organs in your body:
<ul>
 	<li>Pituitarty Gland (in the brain)</li>
 	<li>Hypothalamus (In the brain)</li>
 	<li>Pineal gland (In the brain)</li>
 	<li>Thyroid</li>
 	<li>thymus</li>
 	<li>Pancreas</li>
 	<li>Adrenal glands</li>
 	<li>Testicles (in men)</li>
 	<li>Ovaries (in women)</li>
</ul>
A Phthalates and or Parabens disruption in any one or more of these organs can play havoc with your health.
<h3>Symptoms/Conditions related to Phthalates and Parabens</h3>
• Endometriosis
• Infertility
• Breast cancer
• Ovarian cancer
• Prostate cancer
• Testicular cancer
• Decreased sperm count
• Liver toxicity
• Immune effects such as allergies and asthma
• Reproductive toxicity
• Pubertal development

"Oxalate Test",oxalate-test,,2935,"<h3>Do you have toxic levels of Oxalates?</h3>
The above image is Oxalates under a microscope, notice how sharp they are (causing pain) and block up detoxification pathways.

<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Oxalate screening through a spot urine test can be a life saving test. Oxalate is a natural end product of metabolism in the body. It should leave your body through your urine. If your oxalate levels are too high, the extra oxalate can combine with calcium to form kidney stones. These stones are hard masses of chemicals that can get stuck in the urinary tract.

<strong>Excess oxalates can also contribute to serious life threatening problems such as:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Kidney disease</li>
 	<li>Electrolyte imbalances</li>
 	<li>Mineral imbalances</li>
 	<li>Reduce defenses to cancer development</li>
 	<li>Cancer</li>
 	<li>Complex nutritional imbalances</li>
</ul>
<strong>Some symptoms of Oxalate excess include:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Pain</li>
 	<li>Nephrolithiasis</li>
 	<li>Neurological symptoms</li>
 	<li>Vulvodynia (vulvar pain)</li>
 	<li>Fibromyalgia pain</li>
 	<li>Children with autism who exhibit eye-poking behavior have also been shown to have a build up of oxalates behind their eyes, causing tremendous pain</li>
 	<li>Poor health</li>
 	<li>Poor energy</li>
 	<li>Low immunity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Excess Oxalates, a bigger problem than most realize at a genetic level</h3>
Most people these days carry genetic mutations such as VDR, this gene is a vitamin D receptor which goes on to make a powerful substance called GcMAF which is then needed to attack stealth pathogens, viruses and cancer cells.

Most people eating a regular diet are consuming too much glyphosate from modern farming methords, unfortunatly glyphosate converts into glyoxylate which places a bigger burden on the oxalate detoxification pathway which is called ""oxalate hogging"", this means people cant break in down fast enough leading to excess oxalates.  this causes the following problems:
<ul>
 	<li>Poor sulfation (poor liver detoxification)</li>
 	<li>Preventing the proper production of GcMAF (needed to attack stealth pathogens, viruses and cancer cells.)</li>
 	<li>Increasing the need for Zinc, DAO, Lysine, vitamin B 6 (Which results in deficiencies of these nutrients that can't work properly even after supplementing extra amounts)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Foods highest in Oxalates</h3>
It is very important to test your oxalates as most people consume oxalates foods such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Spinach</li>
 	<li>chocolate</li>
 	<li>Black tea</li>
</ul>
And many many more
<h3>How Oxalates build up in your body</h3>
Oxalate build up can be caused by three different sources, the most common of which is diet. Food is a direct source of oxalate and the most common cause of disproportionately
elevated oxalates.  Awareness of oxalates in food and elimination of those foods highest in oxalate such as spinach, soy, almonds, sweet potatoes and raspberries is important.
Candida and Aspergillus species can also produce oxalates – they use glyoxalate in energy production. People with elevations in Candida or Aspergillus frequently have a subsequent
elevation in oxalates metabolites.  A third cause of oxalate build up is genetic polymorphisms (mutations) such as VDR gene mutations.
<h3>About the Oxalate test</h3>
After you purchase this test, our laboratory will post you out a simple spot urine test kit including full instructions and return postage.  Once the sample is received by the laboratory the sample is analysed with test results made available in approximately 7 business days.   Test results will be delivered by email with recommendations of what to do about any findings.

<h3>Are you toxic and suffering from PCB's (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)?</h3>
Polychlorinated Biphenyls also short for (PCBs) were used as lubricants and coolants in transformers, capacitors, and electronic equipment because of a high resistance to heat. However, once PCBs enter the body, they are absorbed by our fat cells and stored. Since PCBs are not water-soluble, they are not excreted from the body and accumulate over a person's lifetime, increasing that person's body burden of PCBs. Polychlorinated biphenyl testing can help you determine the extent of this PCB burden.
<h3>Conditions and Symptoms of PCB toxicity:</h3>
&nbsp;

 	<li>Certain cancers</li>
 	<li>Developmental disorders</li>
</ul>
In adults, a heavy burden of PCBs over time can cause impairments in the brain, nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system, and may cause fertility issues.  A PCB burden affects children more than adults. PCBs are most often passed to children through breastfeeding and trans-placental transfer. PCB exposure in children can impede neuro-behavioral and immune system development. These impediments may cause delayed neuro-behavioral development in motor skills and short term memory, and lower scores on intelligence, psychomotor, and
behavioural tests. A lowered immune system can create many problems in children including allergies, sensitivities and chronic infections.
<h3>Testing for PCB's</h3>
The Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) test can help identify which of the most toxic PCBs you have been exposed to and the burden it may be having on your body. We look at the most commonly found PCBs, which have national reference ranges that have been documented to cause adverse health problems. Levels are given both in parts per million (PPM) and as lipid-adjusted amounts so the clinician can best estimate the total body burden of these compounds.
<h3>About the Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Test</h3>
After you purchase this test, our laboratory will post you an authorized blood specimen order form that you take to your local accredited pathology for collection of your blood (<a href=""http://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/pathology-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Find a pathology near you here</strong></a>).  Once the sample is received by the laboratory the sample is analysed with test results made available in approximately 12-15 business days.   Test results will be delivered by email with recommendations from our practitioners of what to do about any findings.

<h3>How good is your Immunity?  Take the Immune Cytokine test and discover the truth about your immunity.</h3>
&nbsp;
<h3>About Cytokines</h3>
Cytokines serve as molecular messengers between cells mediating normal cellular processes in the body. Cytokines interact with cells of the immune system regulating various inflammatory responses to disease and infection. Cytokines are released by cells into the circulation or directly into tissue. The cytokines locate target immune cells and interact with receptors on the target immune cells by binding to them. The interaction triggers or stimulates specific responses by the target cells. The Cytokine Immune Test assesses both<u> Pro-Inflammatory and Anti-inflammatory</u> groups of cytokines and gives information on up/down regulation needs.

Cytokine imbalances are known to be involved in autoimmune disorders and immune dysfunction. Testing allows analysis of not only cytokine involvement in disease but it also provides an easy solution for monitoring therapy effectiveness.

<h3>About Cytokines</h3>
Cytokines are signaling proteins and glycoproteins that mediate and regular immunity, inflammation and hematopoiesis.  They are also involved in cell growth and differentiation, cell death, angiogenesis, normal development and neuromodulations.

Cytokines are critical to the functional both innate (cell-mediated) and adaptive (antigen specific/humoral) immune systems.  They are known as either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory.  Pro-inflammatory cytokines include interferon-gamma (INFγ), interleukin-2 (IL2) and interleukin-12 (IL12); whereas interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-5 (IL5) are anti-inflammatory.

Generally pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted from T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines are secreted from T-helper 2 (Th2) cells.  Under normal circumstances the Th1 and Th2 systems should be in balance.
<h3>Cytokines and Disorders of the Immune System</h3>
Over-activation of either the Th1 or Th2 system can cause disease, being active even when there is no threat. When Th1 is dominating abnormally, organ specific autoimmune type diseases can result. On the other hand, when the Th2 system is dominating, disorders that are primarily allergy or antibody driven occur. The body becomes overly sensitive to ‘extracellular pathogens’, often reacting and producing antibodies against non‐pathogenic stimuli such as food and dust.

<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>
<h3>Does your gut have good immunity?</h3>
Secretory IgA (sIgA) is found in high concentrations in the secretions of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and respiratory mucosal linings. The most recognised function of sIgA includes its role in ‘immune exclusion’ in which it <strong>prevents viruses, bacteria and other antigens</strong> adhering to and penetrating epithelial mucosa. SIgA may also <strong>inhibit inflammatory processes</strong> that damage the mucosa and preliminary evidence suggests that it may play a role in inducing an antigen specific immune response by a non-inflammatory mechanism. <strong>A sIgA deficiency may lower resistance to infection.</strong>

The gastrointestinal, genitourinary and respiratory mucosal linings represent extensive surfaces for potential assault by microbes. Secretory IgA (sIgA) is found in high concentrations in the secretions that bathe these mucosal cells where it acts as the chief antibody in the first line of <strong>immune defence</strong>. It is a very stable molecule which is resistant to degradation and therefore functions well in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. SIgA is thought of predominantly as a first line of defence as part of the innate immune response, whereas serum IgA is part of the adaptive immune response. In comparison to serum IgA, the functions of sIgA (secretory IgA) are not dependent on the specificity of the IgA molecule.

SIgA can prevent antigens, including viruses, bacteria and bacterial toxins and enzymes, adhering to and penetrating the luminal epithelial mucosa. SIgA complexes with the antigens which facilitates their elimination by peristalsis or mucociliary movements.

&nbsp;
<h3>Looking for a Comprehensive Gut Assessment?</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Look no further than the 4-Pillar Gut Profile test and cover all the bases in one test.</h3>
The 4-Pillar Gut Profile was designed to provide <strong>a comprehensive investigation of the gut microbiome using four key functional diagnostic tests.</strong> Providing the tools to build a solid foundation of investigation takes much of the guesswork out of systemic imbalances, if the bases are covered then a structured and thorough correction plan can be implemented.

<strong>Pillar 1: Complete Microbiome Mapping</strong> -Is a quantitative PCR (qPCR) stool based test that screens for a comprehensive range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and worms that provides you with a true quantitative detection value to correct when certain microorganisms become dysbiotic or otherwise causing health issues. In addition to this an extensive range of GIT chemistry tests are provided within the test.

<strong>Pillar 2: IgG96 Food Sensitivity Testing</strong> -Eliminating the offending foods will create a stronger mucosal immunity. Testing for adverse food reactions is useful for individuals who suspect that a food is responsible for causing their symptoms, but cannot quite identify which food(s). The presence of circulating antibodies may affect each patient differently. Circulating IgG food antibodies are not diagnostic for a specific condition, but indicate an immune response to that food.

<strong>Pillar 3. Intestinal Permeability</strong> – Assessment for leaky gut provides the support of nutrients that might be compromised as a result of a dysregulated microbiome whether from an overgrowth of a pathogen or a particular food intolerance. Providing both fat soluble and water soluble vitamins for our micro-nutrient support network will benefit so many biological functions.

<strong>Pillar 4. SIBO Lactulose Breath Test</strong> –The Lactulose Breath Test for SIBO is designed to take a three-hour picture of how the bacteria in your intestinal system are functioning. When bacteria digest food, they produce gas. It’s when some bacteria that normally live in your lower intestine end up living in your small intestine. The small intestine isn’t set up for these bacteria, so they can cause a lot of problems. When bacteria digest food, they give off Hydrogen and Methane gasses. When these gasses are in your small intestine, they can cause a multitude of problems and symptoms

<strong>Features &amp; Benefits</strong>

CoreBiotic™ combines three spore forming probiotics to help promote the development of a healthy digestive microbiome.  Spore based probiotics are derived from the soil. Traditionally
when people consumed organic produce they ingested soil-based probiotic organisms (SBO). These SBO’s helped maintain a normal microbiome in the intestines. Today with processed foods containing pesticide and hormone residues, people do not consume these beneficial SBO bacteria leading to dysbiosis or microbial imbalance.

Because they are derived from soil and not from dairy, SBO’s are heat stable, dairy-free, pesticide-free, and hormone-free. Safety for humans has been established by double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.  Spore forming probiotic bacteria can withstand stomach and bile acid.  This allows them to pass into the intestines safely without degradation. Once in the intestines they leave the spore form and produce lactic acid which has natural antibacterial properties to prevent growth of pathogenic bacteria. This competitive inhibition helps the beneficial probiotic bacteria proliferate.

Each probiotic in CoreBiotic TM is identified by genomic sequencing for a specific strain.  Only strain-specific probiotics have undergone rigorous genomic studies, guaranteeing accurate strain specificity, potency and safety.  Each of the strains in CoreBioticTM has research on its safety and efficacy.
Suggested Use
Take 2 capsules once daily at least 30 minutes before eating.

"Vaginal Microbiome Dysbiosis Test",vaginal-microbiome-dysbiosis-test,,5486,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Vaginal infections, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis (TV), are among the most common reasons for which women seek medical investigation. However, often infections go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to lack of investigation or inaccurate testing. If left untreated, many of these infections can have serious long term health implications and misdiagnosis leads to incorrect treatment and the high rate of recurrence seen.
<h3>Vaginal Microbiome</h3>
Complex ecosystems of microbes reside in the female reproductive tract. The vagina consists of trillions of microorganisms — mostly bacteria, plus some fungi and viruses. A disruption in this ecosystem, usually a deficiency of Lactobacillus and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, may result in possible infection and unwanted symptoms.

An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, TV or BV in their lifetime and over 30% of women test positive for BV at any given time, with prevalence rates varying over different populations studied.

The vagina is home to a complex ecosystem of organisms that may include bacteria, viruses, parasites and yeasts. Some of these organisms are important in keeping us healthy as they act to discourage other potential pathogens from thriving. Disruptions in balance of any of these can lead to infections and/or uncomfortable symptoms. Every vaginal microbiome is different and factors such as age, hormonal disruptions and even antibiotic/probiotic use can contribute to changes.
<h3>Signs and Symptoms of Vaginal Infections</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Vaginal discharge change in colour, heaviness, consistency</li>
 	<li>Malodorous discharge (foul or fishy odour)</li>
 	<li>Cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix)</li>
 	<li>Dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse)</li>
 	<li>Post-coital bleeding</li>
 	<li>Pain and/or inflammation around or outside vagina</li>
 	<li>Dysuria (painful urination)</li>
 	<li>Genital lesions/ ulcerations</li>
 	<li>FUT2 gene mutations</li>
</ul>

"Lipoprotein (a) Test",lipoprotein-a-test,,5498,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Lipoprotein (a) is an independent risk factor for vascular disease.  Lipoprotein (a) has many properties in common with low density lipoprotein (LDL) but contains a unique protein, apolipoprotein (a) which is structurally different.  Increased plasma lipoprotein levels have been significantly correlated with cardiovascular disease.  Elevated levels may interfere with plasminogen action and promote thrombosis.

Lipoprotein (a) concentrations may be affected by disease states (e.g. kidney failure) but are only slightly affected by diet, exercise and other environmental factors. Most commonly prescribed lipid-reducing drugs have little or no effect on Lp(a) concentration.

High Lp(a) predicts risk of early atherosclerosis independently of other cardiac risk factors, including LDL. In patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, Lp(a) indicates a coagulant risk of plaque thrombosis. Uptake via the LDL receptor is not a major pathway of Lp(a) metabolism. The kidney has been identified as playing a role in Lp(a) clearance from plasma.
<h2>Common Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Congestive heart failure</li>
 	<li>Coronary artery disease</li>
 	<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>

"B Complex Plus Methyl-Free - 100 Capsules",b-complex-plus-methyl-free-100-capsules,,5660,"<h3>Key Benefits and Actions</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Uses non-methylated forms of B12 and folate</li>
 	<li>Healthy energy production support</li>
 	<li>Healthy immune system support</li>
 	<li>No folic acid added</li>
 	<li>No methylated folate</li>
 	<li>Better forms of vitamin B12</li>
 	<li>Better form of vitamin B3</li>
</ul>
Neurotransmitter balance, energy production, hormone balance, and even your metabolism are all dependent upon B vitamins for normal function. As a result, ensuring proper B vitamin sufficiency is incredibly important for overall health.*

B Complex Plus Methyl-Free is a potent B vitamin formula containing the eight essential B vitamins, using non-methylated forms of folate and B12:
<ul>
 	<li>B1 (thiamine)</li>
 	<li>B2 (riboflavin)</li>
 	<li>B3 (niacin)</li>
 	<li>B5 (pantothenic acid)</li>
 	<li>B6 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate)</li>
 	<li>B7 (biotin)</li>
 	<li>B9 (folate as folinic acid)</li>
 	<li>B12 [as dibencozide (adenosylcobalamin) and hydroxocobalamin]</li>
</ul>
This complex promotes healthy immune system function, energy production, hormone balance, positive mood, and homocysteine regulation — without the side effects that some people attribute to methyl groups.*

Diets low in B vitamins, like some vegan or vegetarian diets, often require supplementation. Those with certain genetic variations may also need additional B vitamin support for pathways such as homocysteine regulation and methylation processes.*

This formula provides optimal support of all B vitamins and is ideal for those who are sensitive to methylated forms of B12 and folate.*

While methylcobalamin and methylfolate were strategically left out, non-methylated bioactive forms of B12 (adenosylcobalamin and hydroxocobalamin) and folate (folinic acid) were included for this blend. This formula was intelligently designed to also exclude choline, a methylated nutrient that is often found in B complexes.

Get ready to tackle the day with this powerful, energy-supporting formula!*

M2 Pyruvate Kinase (M2-PK), as measured in faeces, is a tumour marker for colorectal cancer.  Though M2-PK can be elevated in many tumour types, rather than being an organ-specific tumour marker, increased stool (faecal) levels can be used as a early detection of colorectal carcinomas.

The detection of M2-PK does not depend on blood in the stool and is specifically related to changes in tumour metabolism. The M2-PK test is a non-invasive stool test that can be used for the early detection of colorectal cancers and polyps which are known to be the precursors of colorectal cancer.

Increased M2-PK values can sometimes also occur in severe inflammatory diseases which must be excluded by differential diagnosis. If elevated levels of M2PK are present, it is recommended to request more specific tumour marker tests such as (CEA) for bowel cancer, CA 19-9 for pancreatic cancer and CA 72-4 for gastric cancer. This will significantly increase the sensitivity to detect various cancers.

M2PK can be ordered as a single marker or in alliance with a CDSA panel that includes certain GIT markers.

kiran Krishnan(Microbiome labs): As many of you know health starts with the gut, probiotics are beneficial bacteria but they have to be live organisms that are commensal to the gut, they live within the digestive tract. The problem is that most probiotics today never make it through the digestive tract alive and are thereby not functional probiotics.  The other aspect of a true probiotic is its ability to colonize the gut, reside within the natural flora and conduct metabolic functions that are beneficial to the gut and the human host.

A third aspect of a probiotic is that it has to be able to fit within the natural microbiome and influence the microbiome to allow for the natural growth of your own microbiome species that you were born with.

<h3>Why Megasporebiotic works</h3>
Megasporebiotic is a probiotic, it is a unique all spore formula that maintains efficacy during antibiotic therapy, while most probiotic strains that cannot survive digestion the advanced probiotic is proven to survive inside the large intestine. Winning over probiotic strains that cannot survive means that the process of reseeding with probiotic strains in the intestine effectively assisting to rebuild optimal microbiome (good gut bacteria).

The spore biotic blend aims to recondition, often dormant spores can change the condition of the gut instead of reseeding however in the gut this unique probiotic can restore function and overall immunity of the gastrointestinal tract once inside the
<h3>Probiotic and built in Antioxidants</h3>
With a blend of 5 bacillus spores that are naturally designed to survive digestion. The reason for their inherent survivability in the human gastrointestinal tract that allows them to remain intact in digestion comes from their bi-phasic life cycle. This means that the Bacillus spores can transition interchangeably from their dormant form to their active form, depending on the environment.

In its dormant spore form, the probiotic blend of 5 Bacillus will surround itself with an endospore, which is a tough, natural outer shell that protects it from light, heat, pressure, acid, lack of oxygen, and other environmental factors. This key feature is what allows probiotics to survive easily through digestion without the need for enteric-coated capsules or refrigeration.

Once it reaches the intestines, the advanced probiotic can increase microbial diversity by changing the pH, crowding out unwanted pathogens, and increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids. Due to its inherent survivability and lasting health benefits, MegaSporeBiotic™ has become a revolutionary tool in Total Gut

The MTHFR gene is a vital part of your genetic make-up that provides a process to deliver folate, an essential nutrient into your body and is involved in hundreds of chemical reactions in the body.

When you have a genetic mutation in the MTHFR gene you may have a reduced ability to produce the right type of folate that is essential to good health.
<blockquote><strong>“If your health practitioner is not familiar with the folate family of genes, they are missing 90% of the MTHFR problem”.</strong></blockquote>
Understanding your MTHFR gene, how it works and how it can affect your health is now more vital than ever, as we see a large percentage of the population now suffering from mutations in the gene which has resulted in literally thousands of health problems, largely overlooked by medical professionals.

But the MTHFR gene does not work alone, it affects everyone differently depending on their own genetic makeup, so it is extremely important to look deeper into this gene for yourself and understand just how deeply it may be affecting your health, well-being and how it can affect your life expectancy via disease and what you can do about it.

If you want to know how to treat your MTHFR gene mutations the right way, with treatment protocols and guidelines including which supplements work best, including in-depth knowledge of how a genetic practitioner would treat the problem, this book is for you.  Contains rarely talked about strategies that until now was not available to the public.

"BAD GENES – The Genetic Advantage",bad-genes-the-genetic-advantage,,6404,"This book is cutting edge in how your genetics play a role in your health. Most people have bad genes. Genes that influence their health in a negative way, which more often than not get undiagnosed by mainstream medical science. How well your bad genes function and or express themselves, can mean the difference between having a healthy life or suffering from most of the common diseases people experience today.

When you have a genetic mutation or bad gene/s, you may have a reduced ability to produce the right balance of biochemistry that is essential to good health.

Understanding your bad genes, how they work and how they can affect your health, is now more vital than ever, as we see a large percentage of the population now suffering from mutations in these genes. This has resulted in literally millions of health problems, largely overlooked by medical professionals.

Today more than ever, it is extremely important to look deeper into these genes for yourself and understand just how deeply they may be affecting your health, well-being and how you can take actions that most health professionals, don’t even know are possible, to restore your health at a genetic level.

In this book, we will explore the most common bad genes that are leading to some of the worst health problems people are having today.

<strong>Introduction</strong>

This book contains vital information about brain fog, including advanced solutions, causes, treatments, symptoms, genetics, and how genetics play a role in brain fog.

Brain fog could be considered the new brain disease, with many people now asking why they feel foggy in the brain, can’t think straight, feel confused, and have trouble with focus and concentration.

The bigger problem is the danger that brain fog is the warning sign for much more serious brain disorders and or diseases.

In this book, we explore the cause of brain fog, how it started and how it is affecting people with the condition.

Through this exploration, we will show the mechanisms of the disease (how it works) and steps anybody can take to stop the progress of the problem and make necessary repairs to their brain fog.

Many people today are suffering from brain fog or foggy brain.  This is causing big problems for those trying to function in everyday life.  Ignoring and or putting up with the problem is dangerous due to the nature of the condition.

Anybody with brain fog has multiple underlying health problems.  In this book we will discuss each problem and how they work together, to cause the condition.

Unfortunately, some people have genetic mutations that increase their likelihood of developing brain fog.  When you have a genetic mutation/s, you may have a reduced ability to produce the right balance of biochemistry that is essential to prevent brain fog.

Understanding your brain fog genes and your other susceptibilities, how they work, and how they can affect your health, is now more vital than ever, for being able to resolve brain fog and prevent even more serious brain problems as you age.

The information in this book has been used in practice to stop and reverse brain fog while also solving many other related health problems.

"Porphyrins-Spot Urine Test",porphyrins-spot-urine-test,,6471,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Porphyrins are intermediate products in the production of haem which involves at least eight enzymes that are highly sensitive to toxins. Secondary porphyrias (porphyrinurias) are defined as porphyrias that occur without a genetic defect of haem synthesis.  These porphyrias are associated with environmental exposure to toxins and it has been hypothesised that several health disorders have abnormal porphyrin levels associated with chemical exposure.  These conditions include chronic fatigue, multiple chemical sensitivities, learning and behavioral disorders as well as mental conditions.

The porphyrin test is a powerful biomarker of environmental toxicity.  Porphyrins are intermediate products in the production of haem which involves at least eight enzymes that are highly sensitive to toxins.  When certain chemicals are present in the body these enzymes are inhibited, particular porphyrins build-up and a distinctive pattern of porphyrins specific to each toxin is produced.  These patterns of porphyrin production can therefore be used to analyze the presence of environmental toxins in the body and therefore of chemical exposure.  Common toxins which affect porphyrin metabolism include lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, hexachlorobenzene and dioxins.

Several health disorders have abnormal porphyrin levels associated with chemical exposure including chronic fatigue, multiple chemical sensitivities, learning and behavioral disorders, as well as mental health conditions.  Multiple studies have recently revealed that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is also associated with abnormal patterns of porphyrin production.  It was suggested that porphyrins should be routinely measured in ASD and potential ASD treatments should consider monitoring porphyrin levels.
<h2>Common Conditions:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Autism</li>
 	<li>Allergies</li>
 	<li>Multiple chemical sensitivities</li>
 	<li>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</li>
 	<li>Mental health</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Porphyrins Test</h3>
The porphyrins test is a simple <strong>urine test</strong> that can be done right from your home or office.  The test evaluates the levels of 8 important porphyrin markers such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Uroporphyrins I &amp; III</li>
 	<li>7-Carboxy Porphyrin</li>
 	<li>6-Carboxy Porphyrin</li>

<h2>What is Collinsonia Root?</h2>
Collinsonia root, also known as stone root or knob root, is a perennial herb native to the rich woodlands of eastern North America. This remarkable plant has a long history of traditional use as a gastrointestinal tonic, cherished for its ability to support vascular tissue and maintain water balance within the body. The root, which is the most commonly utilized part of the plant, is dark brown with a knotty texture, a hard exterior, and a pungent odor that dissipates upon drying. Known for its potent benefits, Collinsonia root has been a staple in herbal medicine for centuries, particularly for its versatile health-supporting properties.
<h2>Benefits of Stone Root to Support Vascular Tissue</h2>
Stone Root is celebrated for its wide array of health benefits, making it a valuable addition to holistic nutrition. Traditionally, it has been used to support digestive health, providing relief from indigestion, irritable dyspepsia, chronic gastritis, diarrhea, colic, and spasmodic conditions of the stomach and intestines. Its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects are believed to play a crucial role in these benefits. Additionally, Stone Root is known to support vascular tissue health and may help increase urine flow, thereby promoting kidney function and overall urinary system health.

<span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Mast cells are part of the immune system and are primarily responsible for generating and releasing histamine in the body. Under typical conditions, this is a natural function of a healthy body working to rid itself of an allergen. However, mast cells can become overactive, releasing a cascade of histamine throughout the body, which results in heightened or continuous allergy symptoms.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Many allergy support supplements, such as diamine oxidase (DAO), focus on reducing histamine within the gut by utilizing enzymes to degrade the histamine. Unfortunately, this means they are limited in their function and only effective for reducing ingested histamine (i.e., histamine introduced to the body through the </span><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">food we eat</span><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">) within the GI tract. However, mast cells release histamine systemically. Therefore, when mast cells are activated, they release histamine throughout the body. Enzymes such as DAO do nothing to address the healthy function of mast cells or support the body’s healthy response to histamine and therefore serve limited benefit.</span>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">How does HistaQuel® support mast cell health?</span></h3>
<span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">HistaQuel® utilizes a comprehensive approach to support healthy mast cell function and histamine response systemically.* Seven clinically researched flavonoids and herbs have been combined to promote healthy levels of histamine production and healthy levels of histamine absorption.* This holistic approach resulted in a comprehensive formula featuring dual mechanisms of action.</span>

"Adrenocortex Profile, Basic + Female hormones Test",adrenocortex-profile-basic-female-hormones-test,,6715,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Hormones are crucial to a woman’s reproductive health. Glands produce the main hormones affecting the menstrual cycle and fertility in the brain and by the ovaries. Those hormones regulate menstruation, fertility, and sex drive (libido) – any one of which can be adversely affected if the production of these hormones goes out of balance. As most women approach mid-life, hormonal changes gradually cause reproductive organs to shut down eventually leading to menopause.  <strong>This condition can affect both young and older women.</strong>
<h3>This is a combined test including tests 1005 &amp; 1001</h3>
<strong>Test 1005:</strong> Hormones are tremendously complex and during the pre-menopausal years, imbalanced hormones can pose challenges with mood stabilization, conception, and regulation of your menstrual cycle. The Female Hormone Profile provides valuable information on an individual’s hormonal status and the potential impact this may have on physical and emotional health.

Hormone-related symptoms can occur from the age when a menstrual cycle commences. Generally, hormonal issues are usually not a clear-cut case of one hormone level being abnormal or even one hormone system. In fact, because of the role that hormones play as chemical messengers to wake up the genome in specific target tissues throughout the body, it makes sense that all hormone systems work in concert with each other to maintain a state of balance.

Salivary hormone measurements provide an effective analysis of estrogens, progesterone, and testosterone in determining the need for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Hormone levels may be normal, indicating that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is not needed.

<strong>Test 1001:</strong> Each person has two adrenal glands located on top of the body’s two kidneys. These glands are important to the body’s endocrine (hormonal) system. Adrenal fatigue is a very common condition in today’s society through the physical and physiological demands we put on our adrenal glands. Each gland is composed of two distinct zones, the large outer cortex, and the inner medulla.

Salivary cortisol testing is an effective, non-invasive salivary hormone test that evaluates bioactive levels of the body’s important stress hormones, cortisol, and DHEA. This hormone test (stress test) serves as a critical tool for uncovering biochemical imbalances underlying anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, dysglycemia, and a host of other clinical conditions that may affect our day-to-day lives. This hormone test examines 4 saliva samples over a 12-hour period for levels of cortisol and DHEA. The Adrenocortex test should be used as a general screening test as it plays such an important role in a healthy life.

"Mycotoxin Exposure Extensive Test – Urine",mycotoxin-exposure-extensive-test-urine,,6757,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of mold that have adverse effects on your health. These toxins are produced by some species of mold. These mycotoxins are some of the most toxic substances in existence and cause a wide range of health conditions. When people are around toxic mold they are usually exposed to airborne mycotoxins by breathing them in. These mycotoxins end up in the lungs and cause breathing problems and other severe symptoms.

An E8500 Mycotoxin Panel which are unique profile for identifying the existence of Mycotoxins in the body. The reporting format will identify whether the mycotoxin is <strong>‘PRESENT’</strong> or <strong>‘NON-PRESENT’</strong>

<strong>Tricothecenes:</strong> Are mycotoxins produced by a number of different fungi such as Stachybotrys and Fusarium. Their mechanism of action is the inhibition of protein synthesis, therefore they are known to kill cells and are extremely dangerous. It is known that when Stachybotrys grows in a mold-infested building, the organism produces tricothecene mycotoxins. It is also known that these toxins can get into the air where than can be inhaled.

<strong>Aflatoxins:</strong> These are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus. The organisms that usually produce aflatoxins are Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and can be cancer-producing.

<strong>Ochratoxin A:</strong> Is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium verrucous and is one of the most abundant food-contaminating mycotoxins in the world. Human exposure occurs mainly through the consumption of improperly stored food products, particularly contaminated grain and pork products, as well as coffee, wine grapes, and dried grapes.

<strong>Gliotoxins: </strong>Gliotoxin is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus fumigatus, a major cause of death in immunocompromised patients (e.g. transplant, HIV, Cancer). Gliotoxin has been demonstrated to have significant immunosuppressive effects and may play a role in the evasion of host defenses in Invasive Aspergillosis.

Fatty acid imbalances can be a causative factor in a variety of chronic health conditions. The Essential Fatty Acids Profile assesses the critical balance between essential Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Fatty Acids Profile can indicate the need for fatty acid supplementation and/or dietary modification.

You can’t manage what you don’t measure. Omega-3, omega-6, and<em> trans</em> fats all play a role in your health and are related to risk for heart disease. Tracking these numbers can help you optimize them for your health. The Omega-3 Index, Trans Fat Index, Omega-6/Omega-3 ratio, and AA/EPA ratio all respond to what you eat. You can change your numbers simply by changing what you eat. Everyone responds differently to lifestyle changes so the only way to know how your blood levels respond is to test. We recommend testing and re-testing every 4 months to confirm you are getting the right mix of fats in your diet.

Iron is an essential trace element that is mainly derived from dietary sources. Iron is needed to assist in the formation of adequate numbers of normal red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron is a critical part of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it as blood travels to other parts of the body. Iron is also needed by other cells, especially muscle. Low iron levels can lead to anaemia, in which the body does not have enough red blood cells.

NHG offers a comprehensive iron study assessment that will detect and evaluate abnormalities of iron metabolism by measuring Iron, Ferritin, Transferrin, and Transferrin Saturation.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In the past decade, CVD has been the cause of over one-third of all premature deaths in Australia. The conventional risk factors for CVD include hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. However, in an individual, the presence of only one of these factors has a low positive predictive value. The most advanced strategy for coronary risk assessment is therefore to combine the information of several risk factors; a ‘multi-marker’ approach that enhances risk stratification.

Being one of the leading causes of death worldwide, more years of potential life before the age of 75 are lost due to this disease than any other human condition. Fortunately, over the past thirty years, significant progress has been made in the areas of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CVD. One of the most critical advances has been the identification of the major risk factors for CVD which arose from studies such as the Framingham Heart Study and the Seven Countries Study.

The conventional risk factors for CVD include hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol. However, in an individual, the presence of only one of these factors has a low positive predictive value. Furthermore, a significant number of cardiovascular events still occur in individuals without these established risk indicators. At present, the most advanced strategy for coronary risk assessment is therefore to combine the information of several risk factors. This multi-marker approach can enhance risk stratification, identifying those individuals with a moderate baseline risk who might benefit from aggressive risk reduction strategies. Not only are conventional risk factors assessed, but other CVD biomarkers such as lipoprotein (a), apolipoproteins A &amp; B, homocysteine, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) are included.

The Comprehensive 2 option for the Cardiovascular Profile includes Liposcreen LDL-Subfraction analytes. Liposcreen separates and quantifies all lipoprotein sub-fractions including the ‘large’, less atherogenic LDL-1 and LDL-2 and the ‘small’, highly atherogenic LDL-3 to LDL-7. The test also measures VLDL and IDL cholesterol linked with type III dyslipidemia and associated hyperlipoproteinaemias.

Traditional lipid profiles do not identify the risk of cardiovascular diseases that are caused by the presence of small dense LDL and IDL particles. Dangerous LDL particles may hide behind normal cholesterol levels and, conversely, elevated cholesterol levels do not inevitably have to be associated with a heart attack risk.

Liposcreen separates and quantifies all lipoprotein sub-fractions including the ‘large’, less atherogenic LDL-1 and LDL-2 and the ‘small’, highly atherogenic LDL-3 to LDL-7.   The test also measures VLDL and IDL cholesterol linked with type III dyslipidemia and associated hyperlipoproteinaemias.

<em>Approximately 50% of patients without heart attack have higher cholesterol levels. A considerable portion of heart attack patients has low cholesterol levels.</em>

Individual differences exist in particular with respect to the LDL levels and here, even more importantly, in the size distribution of the LDL particles. The small LDL particles in particular have a very high atherogenic potential. Therefore, it is less important how much cholesterol a patient has but which type of cholesterol is elevated and which size distribution the cholesterol particles have. These are the parameters the risk assessment and therapy depend on.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In the past decade, CVD has been the cause of over one-third of all premature deaths in Australia. LDL particles are heterogeneous with varying density, size, charge, and composition. Small dense LDL particles are especially atherogenic and have been linked to an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). These particles penetrate the arterial wall more easily and readily bind with intimal proteoglycans, which may further increase the susceptibility of the lipoprotein to oxidation.

The NutriPATH Oxidised LDL test is an advanced biomarker for coronary artery disease. This test measures levels of oxidized low-density lipoproteins using a highly sensitive and specific analysis. This test is Low-density lipoproteins (LDL), the major carrier of circulating cholesterol, are very susceptible to oxidation. It is seen that elevated oxidized LDL is associated with accelerated atherogenesis, CAD, acute myocardial infarction, stable and unstable angina, and metabolic syndrome.

"Copper, Ceruloplasmin & Zinc Test",copper-ceruloplasmin-zinc-test,,6790,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

The Copper, Ceruloplasmin &amp; Zinc profiles provide useful information and are an excellent way to determine immune status and the nutritional intake and/or absorption of zinc and copper.

Zinc is an essential marker for the proper functioning of the immune system. Zinc is required for the activity of over 300 enzymes and is involved in most major metabolic pathways. Either a deficiency or excess in this marker can affect the human body significantly causing a wide variety of symptoms.

The immune system depends on zinc in almost every aspect. Zinc has an inverse relationship with copper in the body. This means that as zinc goes down, copper goes up and the same principle applies vice versa.

Adequate copper levels are essential for the growth of new blood vessels, wound healing, and recovery from heart attacks and strokes. When levels are only slightly above normal physiological amounts, copper can be toxic. Any mild abnormality or impairment of liver function can lead to copper excess.

Ceruloplasmin is an important marker often ordered in conjunction with copper. Caeruloplasmin is a copper-containing enzyme that plays a role in the body’s iron metabolism. The liver binds copper to apocaeruloplasmin to produce caeruloplasmin and then releases it into the bloodstream. About 95 percent of the copper in the blood is bound to caeruloplasmin.

Blood typing is a test that physicians commonly use to find out which one of the four blood types you have. Blood types are categorized using a blood typing system called the <strong>ABO system</strong>. It is important to know your blood type as this depends on whether or not there are certain proteins, called antigens, on your red blood cells.

NutriPATH offers a blood group type assessing whether you have a Blood Group: O, A, B, or AB. Your blood sample is mixed with antibodies against type A and B blood, and the sample is checked to see whether or not the blood cells stick together.
The NutriPATH ABO blood typing system will group your blood into one of four categories:
• <strong>O</strong>: type O individuals can donate blood to anyone, but can receive blood only from other type O individuals.
• <strong>A</strong>: type A individuals can donate to another type A individuals and type B individuals. Type A individuals can receive blood only from another type A individuals and type O individuals.
• <strong>B</strong>: type B individuals can donate blood to other B individuals and AB individuals. Type B individuals can receive blood only from type B individuals and type O individuals.
• <strong>AB</strong>: type AB individuals can give blood only to other AB individuals, but can receive the blood of any type.

The advanced dried urine test for hormones is an ideal test for complex hormone patients. This comprehensive assessment (D.U.T.C.H) is unique for what it can reveal from such a simple collection.

This test will measure and identify: Estrogens (x13), Progestagens (x7), Androgens (x6), Glucocorticoids (x4), and free Cortisol (x4), free Cortisone (x4), and Melatonin (x4). The advanced hormone profile is collected off four separate dried urine samples at key time points throughout the same day: 1st morning, 2nd morning, early evening, and bedtime. Urine is collected on filter paper strips either by dipping it in urine collected in a cup or by urinating directly on the strip.

This test is ideal for a comprehensive overview of a patient’s hormonal status or trying to find the underlying cause of a real complex hormone-related issue. Reporting of this profile is practitioner and patient-friendly in the sense that it provides detailed explanations and comments based on the test results as well as a symptomatology chart indicated by the patient and how these symptoms reflect the test results.

The estrogen metabolite assessment detects the urinary products of estrogen metabolism. The metabolites have their own specific biological actions; some have the stimulatory properties of estradiol, whilst others are weak and protective estrogen molecules. An imbalance in estrogen metabolism has been associated with osteoporosis, high blood pressure, lupus, and cancer (breast, endometrial, prostate, thyroid, head, and neck). As the estrogen metabolites are modifiable by lifestyle and nutritional changes, this test is useful for not only establishing risk but monitoring therapies that can reduce the probability of these disorders.

Estrogen has positive effects on the cardiovascular system, bones, brain, skin as well as reproductive organs. The issues experienced at menopause such as memory loss, osteoporosis, and vaginal dryness validate the importance of maintaining optimal estrogen levels. However, if you have too much estrogen in the body, it may increase the risk of hormone-related cancers such as endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer.

The view that all estrogens are ‘bad’ and cause cancer is a simplistic one. However, Estradiol (E2) and Estrone (E1) are metabolized into at least 14 different species. These breakdown products have their own specific biological actions; some have the stimulatory properties of estradiol whilst others are weak and antagonistic to other estrogen molecules. An imbalance of the stimulatory versus weak estrogen metabolites has been observed to be associated with many different health disorders. Whilst high levels of the 16α-hydroxyestrone stimulatory estrogen raise cancer risk, lower levels are associated with osteoporosis. In contrast, if the weak estrogens are high they protect against cancer but inhibit bone growth. Therefore the estrogen metabolites are not inactive excretion products but powerful molecules in their own right and should be monitored.

The estrogen metabolites profile level 3 is the most comprehensive assessment as it looks at a comprehensive scope of estrogen metabolites for the prevention and treatment of estrogen-related symptoms and conditions. This robust urine analysis is ideal for monitoring and assessing the risk of estrogen-related diseases.

Pharmacogenomics falls within the emerging paradigm of personalized medicine. It is mainly focused on how genes affect a person’s response to various medications. Pharmacogenomics cleverly combines pharmacology (the science of drugs/medications) and genomics (the study of genes). With Pharmacogenomics one may predict the response to medications and the dose. The benefit of pharmacogenomics to the practitioner is that it leads to improved decision-making when prescribing, which ultimately leads to better therapeutic responses, safety, and enhanced health outcomes.

<strong>The My Cardiovascular Medication DNA Profile Code 8015</strong> identifies the genetic variants that may affect how a patient could respond to Cardiovascular medication, this makes the decision of which medication is best suited to you and your genetics.

"Gluten Sensitivity Genetic Test",gluten-sensitivity-genetic-test,,6835,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

The test detects the genes (human leukocyte antigens or HLA) that control the immune system’s reaction to gluten.  There are several types of HLA genes within each person and it is HLA-DQ that is most useful in the assessment of the probability that a person may be gluten sensitive. The reason gene testing assesses probability rather than the disease itself is because some people have the genes for gluten sensitivity but have no detectable evidence of the immune reaction to gluten or have no symptoms. In such people, gluten sensitivity is still possible but the probability is lower than in a person who may be having symptoms attributable to gluten or that has antibodies detected.

HLA testing is most useful when there is diagnostic confusion about whether or not a person is gluten sensitive. Such confusion often stems from one of the following: atypical intestinal biopsy results, the presence of associated diseases (such as microscopic colitis) that may mask the expected improvement of symptoms when gluten is withdrawn from the diet, negative tests for gluten antibodies in the midst of suggestive symptoms or signs of gluten sensitivity or coeliac disease, or when there are no symptoms at all and the person or the doctor can hardly believe that gluten sensitivity is really present. Other situations in HLA testing are useful when a person is already on a gluten-free diet and for testing family members (particularly children) for the probability that they have or will develop gluten sensitivity.

The test utilizes stool rather than blood as the testing substrate for food sensitivity; the rationale is that immunologic reactions to proteins in the diet that cause these reactions are centered within the intestinal tract and not in the blood.

The calprotectin stool test that NHG offers is used to detect inflammation in the intestines. Intestinal inflammation can be associated with bacterial infections and in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The calprotectin test may be used to distinguish between IBD and non-inflammatory disorders and to monitor IBD disease activity.

Testing for fecal calprotectin is a useful screening tool for identifying patients who are most likely to have an endoscopy for suspected inflammatory bowel disease.

The main diseases that cause increased excretion of fecal calprotectin are infectious colitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and neoplasms (cancer). Essentially, an elevated calprotectin indicates that inflammation is likely to present in the gastrointestinal tract.

Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) develops when hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body, joins with glucose in the blood, becoming 'glycated'. For patients especially those with diabetes, this is important as the higher the HbA1c, the greater the risk of developing diabetes-related complications. In Australia, it is said that 1-4 Australians over the age of 25 have pre-diabetes.

NHG offers both a spot method and whole blood analysis in measuring HbA1c. This test is extremely important to assess in those that have already been diagnosed with diabetes. Red blood cells in the human body survive for 8-12 weeks before renewal, measuring HbA1c can be used to reflect average blood glucose levels over that duration, providing a useful longer-term gauge of blood glucose control.

Methylation is a process where certain nutrients called ‘methyl donors’ are added to specific elements of DNA, our gene markers, and proteins that keep them physiologically active.  Methylation is a major pathway to focus on in understanding autoimmune and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, dementia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders.  Methylation is responsible for making, maintaining, and repairing DNA.

The methylation cycle is a biochemical pathway that manages or contributes to a wide range of biochemical functions: detoxification, supporting DNA (turning genes on and off), producing energy, reducing inflammation, synthesizing neurotransmitters, homocysteine metabolism, protein methylation, phase 2 liver detoxification and supporting immune function.  Inadequate methylation capacity can lead to birth defects, depression, cognitive decline, and cancer.  Impaired methylation has even been associated with autism.  Support of methylation markers has been associated with rapid return of speech, and improvement of behavior in ADD and ADHD spectrums.

"Estrogen Metabolites Spot Urine Test",estrogen-metabolites-level-2-spot-urine-test,,6872,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

The estrogen metabolite tests detect the urinary products of estrogen metabolism. The metabolites have their own specific biological actions; some have the stimulatory properties of estradiol, whilst others are weak and protective estrogen molecules. An imbalance in estrogen metabolism has been associated with osteoporosis, high blood pressure, lupus, and cancer (breast, endometrial, prostate, thyroid, head, and neck). As estrogen metabolites are modifiable by lifestyle and nutritional changes, this test is useful for not only establishing risk but monitoring therapies that can reduce the probability of these disorders.

Estrogen has positive effects on the cardiovascular system, bones, brain, skin as well as reproductive organs. The issues experienced at menopause such as memory loss, osteoporosis, and vaginal dryness validates the importance of maintaining optimal estrogen levels. However, if you have too much estrogen in the body, it may increase the risk of hormone-related cancers such as endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer.

The view that all estrogens are ‘bad’ and cause cancer is a simplistic one. Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are metabolized into at least 14 different species. These breakdown products have their own specific biological actions; some have the stimulatory properties of estradiol whilst others are weak and antagonistic to other estrogen molecules. An imbalance of the stimulatory versus weak estrogen metabolites has been observed to be associated with many different health disorders. Whilst high levels of the 16α-hydroxyestrone stimulatory estrogen raise cancer risk, lower levels are associated with osteoporosis. In contrast, if the weak estrogens are high they protect against cancer but inhibit bone growth. Therefore the estrogen metabolites are not inactive excretion products but powerful molecules in their own right and should be monitored.

Heavy metal toxicity is a common issue in Australia and lots of people are widely affected by this health condition. Heavy metals, such as mercury, lead and aluminium, can accumulate in the body over time and can lead to a number of concerning symptoms and health conditions. Heavy metal toxicity is primarily caused by the levels of pollution and use of chemicals that we are exposed to on a day to day basis.

NHG offer an advanced screening test for the water people drink which influences their metal and mineral status. This is especially true during chelation. It is important to know about the metal and mineral content of the water that you consume.

In most circumstances, water is processed through filters and water systems however, in rural areas, for instance, water supply systems are often inadequate or not available, and contaminated water remains in the water that is consumed by humans.

The test profile offered by NutriPATH will provide you with an easy, safe, and economical way to test for several of the most common contaminants found in your drinking water.

Omega‐3 fatty acids are essential to the human body and have benefits for our heart, brain, eyes, and joints. By reducing inflammation, and blood clots, and improving membrane function, omega‐3 fats are associated with a lower risk of heart complications – including heart disease, plaque build‐up, and heart attacks – both in persons with a history of heart disease and in healthy individuals. Omega‐3 fats are important for optimal brain development in babies and mental function, particularly later in life.  An imbalance in the levels of omega 6 fatty acids in comparison to omega 3 is commonly found in the western population.

Because Arachidonic Acid (AA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) are key essential fatty acids modulating inflammation, the AA:EPA ratio has become a measure of inflammation.  A high ratio indicates increased levels of inflammation and has been detected in insulin resistance, coronary artery disease, and depression.

"Comprehensive Metabolic Profile Test",comprehensive-metabolic-profile-test,,6908,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

The Comprehensive Metabolic Profile is an in-depth assessment that includes the following components:

<strong>Urea Electrolytes and Creatinine (UEC)</strong> is a measure of kidney function. UEC measures, Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Bicarbonate (HCO3), Urea, eGFR, and creatinine. These analytes reflect kidney function, and metabolic acidosis and provide clinical value in the diagnosis and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

<strong>Liver function tests (LFT) </strong>is a hepatic panel that identifies the function of the liver. The liver processes drugs and alcohol, filter toxic chemicals, stores vitamins, and minerals, and makes bile, proteins, and enzymes. LFT tests the levels of a number of proteins and enzymes that are either produced by liver cells or released into the blood when liver cells are damaged, namely ALP, ALT, AST, GGT, Albumin, Total Protein, and Bilirubin.

<strong>Lipids </strong>test identifies fat metabolism markers to monitor and screen for risk of cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol and triglycerides are lipids or fats which are important for cellular health but can be harmful when they build up in the blood. Lipids identify measures of cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and the risk ratios.

<strong>Glucose</strong> identifies blood sugar levels, which when out of balance, may be associated with diabetes, insulin resistance, or insulin sensitivity.

<strong>Urate (UA) </strong>identifies the level of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is produced when the body breaks down foods that contain organic compounds called purines. High levels of uric acid can cause gout.

<strong>Magnesium (Mg)</strong> is a mineral and electrolyte responsible for many functions in the blood. Mg is required for muscle, nerve, and cardiovascular function.

<strong>Phosphate (Phos) </strong>in the blood measures mineral phosphorus levels inactive to kidney disease or bone disorders. The kidneys remove excess phosphate from the blood. Phosphate is an electrically charged particle that contains the mineral phosphorus. Phosphorus supports calcium in bone health.

<strong>Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) </strong>an enzyme protein is released into blood and body fluids when body tissue is damaged by disease or injury. LDH levels are used to monitor cancer therapy or may be raised in conditions like anemia, liver disease, lung disease, and some types of infections.

<strong>Calcium </strong>test measures calcium in the blood essential for the proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart. Calcium is the primary mineral in the blood needed for healthy bones and teeth. An imbalance of Calcium may be a sign of bone, thyroid, kidney disease, or other medical conditions.

"IGF1 & IGF-BP3 Blood Test",igf1-igf-bp3-blood-test,,6915,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a natural hormone the body produces. It contains seventy amino acid polypeptides that are produced by the liver and endocrine hormone system. IGF-1 also plays a role in cell repair in the muscles, brain, and heart.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), also called somatomedin C, is a hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin. It plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults.

IGF-1 is produced primarily by the liver as an endocrine hormone as well as in target tissues in a paracrine/autocrine fashion. Production is stimulated by growth hormone (GH) and can be dysfunctional due to undernutrition, growth hormone insensitivity, and lack of growth hormone receptors. Approximately 98% of IGF-1 is always bound to one of 6 binding proteins (IGF-BP).

IGFBP-3, the most abundant protein, accounts for 80% of all IGF binding. IGF-1 binds to IGFBP-3 in a 1:1 molar ratio.

IGF-1 is a primary mediator of the effects of growth hormone (GH). Growth hormone is made in the anterior pituitary gland, released into the bloodstream, and then stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1. IGF-1 then stimulates systemic body growth and has growth-promoting effects on almost every cell in the body especially skeletal muscle, cartilage, bone, liver, kidney, nerves, skin, and lungs.  In addition to the insulin-like effects, IGF-1 can also regulate cell growth and development, especially in nerve cells as well as cellular DNA synthesis.

This test is used to diagnose certain pancreas disorders related to not producing enough digestive enzymes and aid in the diagnosis of the exocrine pancreatic function or insufficiency.

The pancreatic elastase test short for (PE1) is a non-invasive stool test that is commonly used to assess patients with chronic pancreatitis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease and other situations involving exocrine pancreas dysfunction. The PE1 results are not affected by pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy therefore, patients are not required to stop supplementation prior to stool collection. The PE1 test allows the clinician to establish a prompt and reliable diagnosis with high degrees of sensitivity in suspected cases of pancreatic insufficiency.

Pancreatic Elastase can be ordered as a single marker or in alliance with a CDSA panel that includes certain GIT markers.

Hormones are crucial to a woman’s reproductive health. The main hormones affecting the menstrual cycle and fertility are produced by glands in the brain and by the ovaries. Those hormones regulate menstruation, fertility, and sex drive (libido) – any one of which can be adversely affected if the production of these hormones goes out of balance. As most women approach mid-life, hormonal changes gradually cause reproductive organs to shut down eventually leading to menopause.

Estradiol (E2) is the major estrogen and is recognized for producing the majority of the functions of estrogen in the body.  It is critical for the development of female reproductive organs, for producing female secondary sexual characteristics and during the menstrual cycle, and, with progesterone, prepares the endometrium for implantation.

A Faecal Occult stool test is a test that can detect tiny traces of blood in the stool which generally is such small traces that are hidden or cannot be seen traditionally under normal stool tests. The test is clinically useful as it can indicate the presence of disease at a relatively early stage when stools may appear normal. It is highly recommended to have this test ordered if you have a family history of bowel cancer or you suspect that you may have blood in the stool.

Generally, when you test for faecal occult blood there are two types that are commonly used for analyses. There is a chemical test based on a chemical reaction to haem which is a part of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule found in red blood cells. There is also an immunological test that uses antibodies that recognize haemoglobin. At NutriPATH both types of methods are used for testing. The faecal occult blood test is used to detect small amounts of blood in the stool. If the test is positive, a colonoscopy will be needed to find the reason for the bleeding.

A FBE is a commonly used test by physicians as a primary assessment that can help to diagnose a wide range of illnesses, infections and diseases. The FBE test looks for abnormalities in the blood, such as unusually high or low numbers of blood cells. Blood cells include red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Many conditions can cause an abnormal blood count.

NHG offers a Full Blood Examination (FBE) with an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). It is important to have this assessment performed as a general check-up as this test is often used a primary assessment in identifying abnormalities in the blood which could affect one’s health. Everyone’s blood is made up of three main types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. NutriPATH measure the number of cells present, and the size and proportions of these cells from just one simple blood test.

Heavy metal toxicity is a common issue in Australia and lots of people are widely affected by this health condition. Heavy metals, such as mercury, lead and aluminum, can accumulate in the body over time and can lead to a number of concerning symptoms and health conditions. Heavy metal toxicity is primarily caused by the levels of pollution and use of chemicals that we are exposed to on a day to day basis.

NHG offer both a Pre and Post chelation metal test. A challenge test is a means of comparing the respective quantities of heavy metals in two urine samples. The first sample is normally taken from an early morning specimen (Pre-chelation), whilst the second is sampled from a subsequent 24hr urine collection following the administration of a chelating agent (Post-chelation). From this information the physician can compare the excretion patterns before and after administration of the chelating agent, thereby obtaining vital information as to the propensity of the body to store heavy metals.
<h2>Common Conditions:</h2>
• Mental health disorders
• Foggy memory
• Impairment of vital organ systems
• Toxicity
• Allergies
• Immune dysfunction
• Thyroid dysfunction
• Cardiovascular disease
• Muscular skeletal conditions

Heavy metal toxicity can be caused by exposure to pollution, chemicals, and poisons. It is a growing threat to the population as metals deposit in body tissues leading to significant developmental and neurological damage.  Heavy metal toxicities can also lead to numerous health conditions including those affecting the cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, muscle, skeletal, skin, and nervous systems.

Blood analysis provides the best diagnostic tool for assessing the status of metals and minerals that improve cellular function. Blood element levels are useful for assessing cardiac influences, anti-inflammatory processes, anemia, immunological function, and particularly toxic levels of metals.

Bone is continuously remodeled through a process of osteoclast-mediated bone formation and resorption. This process can be monitored by measuring urine markers of bone formation and resorption known as N-Telopeptides (NTx).  Unbalanced bone turnover is found in age-related and postmenopausal osteopenia and osteoporosis.

Approximately 90% of the organic matrix of bone is a type I collagen, a helical protein that is cross-linked at the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule. The amino acid sequences and orientation of the cross-linked alpha 2 N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen make it a specific marker of human bone resorption. N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) molecules are mobilized from bone by osteoclasts and subsequently excreted in the urine. Elevated levels of NTx indicate increased bone resorption.

Bone turnover markers are physiologically elevated during childhood, growth, and fracture healing. The elevations in bone resorption markers and bone formation markers are typically balanced in these circumstances and of no diagnostic value. By contrast, abnormalities in the process of bone remodeling can result in changes in skeletal mass and shape. Many diseases, in particular hyperthyroidism, all forms of hyperparathyroidism, most forms of osteomalacia and rickets (even if not associated with hyperparathyroidism), hypercalcemia of malignancy, Paget’s disease, multiple myeloma, and bony metastases, as well as various congenital diseases of bone formation and remodeling can result in accelerated and unbalanced bone turnover.

The findings of these oligosaccharide studies are quite impressive:
<ul>
 	<li>FOS increased populations of A. mucin by 8,000% in 5 weeks</li>
 	<li>FOS increased populations of F. prau by 100% in 4 weeks</li>
 	<li>GOS increased populations of Bifido by 10% in 6 weeks</li>
 	<li>XOS increased populations of Bifido by 9% in 8 weeks</li>
</ul>
Increasing populations of these protective bacteria is an integral part of reinforcing a healthy microbiome. Studies have shown that a more diverse  microbiome is associated with a stronger immune system and a decreased risk for chronic illness. Nourish the powerful ecosystem in your gut with MegaPreBiotic™ today!
<h3>Aren’t all prebiotics the same?</h3>
Prebiotics are essentially dietary fibers that cannot be digested or absorbed by the human digestive tract but instead feed the bacteria living in your gut. The problem is that most prebiotics on the market are not selective.  This means that they can feed both harmful and beneficial gut bacteria, which can often exacerbate digestive issues.

MegaPre™ contains medium-chain carbohydrates, known as oligosaccharides, that cannot be digested by humans but instead target keystone species known as secondary degraders.  Primary degraders feed on the bulkier fibers like cellulose, resistant starches, and inulin and then convert them into intermediate products like acetate, lactate, and oligosaccharides that can then feed the butyrate-producing secondary degraders.

These complex fibers are important because they can feed beneficial bacteria, but they can also be utilized by harmful bacteria. For this reason, we decided to skip the first step and provide the gut microbiome with the intermediate byproducts that it needs to produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate.

The oligosaccharides used in MegaPre™ have been clinically shown to significantly increase keystone species like Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Bifidobacteria - all of which are very important for healthy metabolism, intestinal barrier function, and body composition.
<h3>MegaPre &amp; Immunity</h3>
Research shows that the ingredients in MegaPre™ can help support a strong immune system through the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can subsequently stimulate intestinal cells to produce a protective compound known as β-defensin that can help to keep the gut microbiome in balance.

One study found that consuming Livaux® gold kiwifruit concentrate, found in MegaSporeBiotic™, could modulate the immune system by increasing the production of T-cells and immunoglobulins, such as IgG, which can help support a balanced gut microbiome.  Another study conducted on the effects of B-GOS on immune function in elderly adults found that the lactose-derived B-GOS significantly increased phagocytosis and natural killer cell activity, two components which are essential for a strong immune system.
<h3>Key Functions of Megpre</h3>
• Diversify the microbiome
• Support keystone species
• Support immunity

<strong>Introduction</strong>

This book is cutting edge in how your genetics play a role in your gut health. Most people have gene mutations, genes that can influence their gut health in a negative way, which more often than not gets undiagnosed by mainstream medical science.

How well your gut genes function and or express themselves, can mean the difference between having a healthy life or suffering from even serious gut health problems many people experience today.

When you have genetic mutations in your digestive system, you may have a reduced ability to produce the right balance of biochemistry that is essential to good gut health.

Understanding your gut genes, how they work and how they can affect your health, is now more vital than ever, as we see a large percentage of the population now suffering from mutations in these gut genes, which has resulted in literally thousands of health problems, largely overlooked by medical professionals.

Today more than ever, it is extremely important to look deeper into these genes for yourself and understand just how deeply they may be affecting your health, and wellbeing and how you can take actions that most health professionals, don’t even know are possible, to restore your gut health at a genetic level.

In this book, we will explore the most common genes that are leading to some of the worst gut health problems people are having today.

kiran Krishnan(Microbiome labs):  Most prebiotics available will feed both good and bad biotics equally, they are basically carbohydrates that are fermentable by bacteria but they don't have any specific structure that distinguishes is the capability of feeding good or bad bacteria so this is where Megaprebiotic has taken this problem to the next level by choosing ingredients that just focus on feeding just good bacteria.

This focus has enabled us to use 4 different oligosaccharides which are some of the most important types of prebiotics as is found in mothers' milk because they are the best types of prebiotics to feed only good bacteria.
<h5>MegaPre™ is the first Precision Prebiotic™ supplement that can effectively diversify your gut microbiome without feeding potential pathogens.</h5>

The mucosal system is a very important part of the human immune system. Not many people think of mucus as being protective, but it is the main interface between the human body and the outside world. <strong>The mucosal system contains 150 times more surface area than the skin, which makes it one of the most important immune barriers.</strong> The health of the mucosa determines how the body interacts with antigens; therefore, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa can dictate overall immune function.

kiran Krishnan(Microbiome labs): ""Megamucosa it's a mucosa support formula, now when you look at the intestinal lining where a lot of disease starts, it happens in the breakdown of the mucosa, so the mucosa is an actual physical barrier that separates the outside world which is the lumen of the intestines from the inside world which is when things are allowed to get passed the intestinal lining and enter the circulation"".

""<strong>That mucosal barrier is the defense system and also the immune sampling for everything that is entering the body,</strong> now most people don't know that the mucosal system of the body has over 150 more time the surface area than the dermal system (the skin), we always think of our dermal system (our skin) as our biggest area but it is in fact the mucosal system"".
<h5>""And everything starts in the mucosal system when it comes to the inflammatory breakdown in response to the environment that includes environmental toxins, food, bacteria, viruses and so on"".</h5>
&nbsp;

""So it becomes paramount to make sure we are dealing with or have a healthy mucosal layer, now the mucosal layer is made up from something called glycoprotein which is a mix between sugar and amino acid which is the building block of the mucosa"".
<h5>""Even though we can use probiotics and prebiotics to stimulate the rebuilding of the mucosa...</h5>
&nbsp;

if you don't provide the building blocks your body won't be able to rebuild your mucosa"".

""So one of the main components of the megamucosa is that we have added these essential amino acids, there are 4 essential amino acids that go into the product to act as the building blocks, a study has shown that <strong>with the addition of those amino acids when you damaged the mucosal lining it increases the growth of the mucosal lining the repair of the mucosal lining by 95%</strong> compared to not providing those specific amino acids"".

""Now, on top of that <strong>you need to modulate the immune response</strong> and that's where we have selected a very well studied bovine IgG, this is an immunoglobulin specifically the IgG version that studies show helps reduce inflammation in the intestinal lining, it helps modulate the immune response to bacteria, viruses, toxins, food particles which allows for the minimizing of the damage to the mucosa which then allows the mucosa to regenerate and rebuild"".

""So megamucosa becomes a very very essential part of total gut restoration because you can fix the microbiome, you can fix the leakiness of the gut but if you don't have an effective mucosal layer you are not going to solve the problem.""

The dairy-free immunoglobulin concentrate supports healthy digestion, neutralizes environmental toxins, and <strong>helps to REBUILD protective intestinal barriers.</strong> These IgG antibodies can reduce the damage of metabolic endotoxemia and neutralize LPS, an endotoxin that triggers mucosal activation.

There are four key amino acids that play an important role in the production of intestinal mucosa include: L-proline, L-serine, L-cysteine, and L-threonine. These four amino acids have been shown to increase mucin2 production and stimulate mucin synthesis in the colon, resulting in a thicker and healthier mucosal barrier.

MicrobiomeX® is a natural citrus extract rich in polyphenols that support digestive health and immunity by increasing microbial diversity in the gut and maintaining healthy gut barrier function. A clinical study using 500mg of citrus fruit extract found a significant increase in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition, suggesting that these polyphenols may help modulate the microbial composition in the gut.
<h3>Why rebuild your intestinal barrier?</h3>
One of the biggest health risks of today is <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><strong><a style=""color: #0000ff;"" href=""https://www.naturalhealthgroup.com.au/auto-immune-disease/how-to-check-for-leaky-gut-syndrome/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">intestinal permeability and or leaky gut syndrome</a></strong></span>.  Leaky gut syndrome is a condition where your intestinal tract becomes leaky, in other words, the intestinal wall becomes weak allowing toxins, waste products, and undigested foods to pass through the intestinal wall and into your bloodstream which causes a great deal of distress to your body, your organs, unsets your immune system and your health leading to serious diseases including most autoimmune diseases.
<h5>The truth is without a healthy intestinal track you can lose your ability to properly absorb essential nutrients that defend against death-related diseases.</h5>
&nbsp;

The biggest problem with increased intestinal permeability is that once it starts it causes a chain reaction of events that make it hard for the body to repair the problem.  Once the lining of the intestinal wall becomes damaged and allows toxic substances to pass through to the bloodstream other organs such as the liver, kidney and immune system are now under great pressure to attempt to clean up the mess, this causes a vicious cycle, especially with the liver and immune system.
<h3 class=""product_title"">Causes of leaky gut &amp; Intestinal permeability</h3>
<p class=""product_title"">So what causes a leaky gut you may wonder, well there is no one answer, intestinal permeability is one the most important parts of not only digestion but also of nutrition, increased permeability of the intestine leads to reduced intake of essential nutrients, and this happens because essential nutrients are not digested properly making the nutrients unusable, so when you have leaky gut you will also have nutritional deficiencies.  When the permeability becomes increased that’s when the problems start.  We know that a leaky gut is a result of many contributing factors here are just some of the more common causes:</p>

The urinary tract is one of the most common sites for adult bacterial infections, particularly for post-menopausal and elderly women. The use of quantitative PCR technology accurately captures and quantifies the microbiota of the urinary tract providing an essential clinical assessment tool for those experiencing complicated urinary tract infections (UTI).

Extending beyond the bladder to the kidneys, complicated UTI’s are considered more severe than their uncomplicated counterpart, which is usually confined to the bladder and urethra.

Recurring UTI’s can lead to numerous complications including kidney damage, premature birth, low birth weight, and in severe cases sepsis.

<ul>
 	<li>A high-quality source of choline from phosphatidylcholine (PC)</li>
 	<li>Supports healthy cell walls, liver, and brain</li>
 	<li>Supports healthy fetal development during pregnancy</li>
</ul>
<h4 class=""cust-head-right "">Who Needs Optimal PC</h4>
<div class=""need-description paragraph-style"">

Are you looking for a high-quality choline supplement?<sup>†</sup>

The majority of your body’s choline is found in phospholipids, the most common being phosphatidylcholine (PC).<sup>†</sup>

<strong><i>Optimal PC</i> soft gels provide 800 mg of soy-free phospholipids from non-GMO sunflower lecithin.</strong><sup>†</sup>

<i>Optimal PC</i> offers a convenient way to supply your body with the essential nutrient choline from phosphatidylcholine (PC). Each soft gel serving provides a smaller dose compared to our Optimal PC Liquid.<sup>†</sup>

It is uncommon for our bodies to make enough choline to meet daily needs. Vegan and vegetarian diets, aging, exercise, liver conditions, and pregnancy present an increased risk for choline deficiency.<sup>†</sup>

Food sources of choline include liver, beef, and egg yolks. However, most modern diets do not provide sufficient dietary intake levels.<sup>†</sup>

Your cell membranes are like the walls of your home: they keep beneficial things inside (like nutrients) while protecting your cells from invaders. Cell walls and membranes can become weak and ‘leaky’ from a lack of choline in your diet.<sup>†</sup>

In the body, choline is converted into the phospholipids your body needs for numerous functions.<sup>†</sup>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cell walls </strong>are membranes made primarily from phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine. PC is required for strong membranes throughout the body.<sup>†</sup></li>
 	<li>Nearly half of your body’s <strong>methylation</strong> processes go toward producing phosphatidylcholine (PC)<sup>†</sup></li>
 	<li>PC is metabolized into choline to provide important methyl groups needed to recycle homocysteine to methionine. This supports healthy <strong>homocysteine</strong> levels.<sup>†</sup></li>
 	<li>PC is a major component of <strong>bile</strong> production and flow.<sup>†</sup></li>
 	<li>PC supports the normal repair of cell walls. This can support healthy <strong>histamine</strong> levels by keeping histamine inside of your cells. PC also provides methyl groups for the HNMT enzyme to metabolize histamine.<sup>†</sup></li>
 	<li>PC supports healthy <strong>liver function</strong>, protection, and detoxification.<sup>†</sup></li>
 	<li>Intense <strong>exercise</strong> can deplete choline levels. <i>Optimal PC</i> can help replenish choline levels, supporting healthy energy levels and normal muscle recovery.<sup>†</sup></li>
 	<li>PC is essential for optimal neurological and brain function. It is a significant component of <strong>nerve and brain</strong> cells and neurotransmitter signaling.<sup>†</sup></li>
</ul>
It can be difficult to achieve an adequate intake of PC through dietary sources alone. Formulated by epigenetics expert Dr. Ben Lynch, <i>Optimal PC</i> makes it easy to support your daily intake of choline.<sup>†</sup>

<i>Optimal PC</i> by Seeking Health provides choline via phosphatidylcholine (PC). Two additional phospholipids that promote brain and cell wall health are also included: phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI).<sup>†</sup>

<i>Optimal PC</i> supports balanced:<sup>†</sup>
<ul>
 	<li>Choline levels</li>
 	<li>Cell walls and membranes</li>
 	<li>Cognition</li>
 	<li>Brain and nerve function</li>
 	<li>Methylation</li>
 	<li>Liver function</li>
 	<li>Bile production and flow</li>
 	<li>Histamine balance</li>
 	<li>Normal repair of ‘leaky’ cells</li>
 	<li>Fetal brain development and genetic expression during Pregnancy</li>
</ul>
Choline is required in higher amounts during pregnancy due to accelerated cell division. Many prenatals do not contain choline, or the amount of choline is negligible. Yet healthy choline levels are required for fetal brain development, methylation, and genetic expression. Pregnant women can support their dietary choline intake with <i>Optimal PC</i>.

<i>Optimal PC</i> was designed to help you support optimal choline and phospholipid levels in your body.

<strong>Introduction</strong>

This book is cutting edge in how your genetics play a role in your health. Most people have bad genes. Genes that influence their health in a negative way, which more often than not get undiagnosed by mainstream medical science. How well your bad genes function and or express themselves, can mean the difference between having a healthy life or suffering from most of the common diseases people experience today when it comes to getting a good night’s sleep.

When you have a genetic mutation or bad gene/s, you may have a reduced ability to produce the right balance of biochemistry that is essential to good health and the ability to get the right balance of sleep and proper rest.

Understanding your bad genes, how they work, and how they can affect your sleep, is now more vital than ever, as we see a large percentage of the population now suffering from mutations in these genes. This has resulted in literally millions of health problems, largely overlooked by medical professionals.

Today more than ever, it is extremely important to look deeper into these genes for yourself and understand just how deeply they may be affecting your sleep and well-being and how you can take actions that most health professionals, don’t even know are possible, to restore your ability to get proper sleep at a genetic level.

In this book, we will explore the most common ways that are leading to some of the worst sleep and insomnia problems people are having today.

When you have a genetic mutation or bad gene/s, you may have a reduced ability to produce the right balance of biochemistry that is essential to good happy disciplined mental health and the ability to properly behave no matter what your age.

Understanding your bad genes, how they work, and how they can affect your behaviour, is now more vital than ever, as we see a large percentage of the population now suffering from an inability to control their kids. This has resulted in literally millions of family and parenting problems, largely overlooked by medical professionals.

Today more than ever, it is extremely important to look deeper into these genes for yourself and understand just how deeply they may be affecting your kids and how you can take actions that most health professionals, don’t even know are possible, to restore your ability to bring back a happy family and a better future for you and your kids as they develop into adults.

In this book, we will explore the most common ways that are leading to some of the worst problems with uncontrollable children and get answers to why them and why now and what you can do to push the odds of gaining back control of your kids, your life and having a happy family into the future.

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is a condition where a patient may have a normal level of mast cells present, but these cells may be over-responsive or overreact to the body.  Symptoms are usually related to the excess and episodic release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. A common presentation is recurrent anaphylaxis where no trigger or cause can be identified. It is often a challenging condition to detect because the inflammatory mediators may only be released during an episode, then return to normal levels. For example, if the patient is amidst a flare-up they may or may not have an elevated serum tryptase level.

<strong>The MCAS Profile- Extensive </strong>assesses in a urine sample <em>Prostaglandin D2, Leukotriene E4, and 2,3 Dinor-11b-Prostaglandin F2a</em>. Prostaglandin D2 is a major inflammatory mediator produced by Mast Cells. Leukotriene E4 is also one of the inflammatory molecules that could be released by mast cells during an attack or flare-up. 2,3 dinner-11beta-prostaglandin F2-alpha is a marker used in the screening of Mast cell activation disorders. N-methyl-histamine is a major histamine metabolite that is produced in the mast cells. Excess levels are seen in Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is a condition where a patient may have a normal level of mast cells present, but these cells may be over-responsive or overreact to the body.  Symptoms are usually related to the excess and episodic release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. A common presentation is recurrent anaphylaxis where no trigger or cause can be identified. It is often a challenging condition to detect because the inflammatory mediators may only be released during an episode, then return to normal levels. For example, if the patient is amidst a flare-up they may or may not have an elevated serum tryptase level.

<b>The MCAS Profile Advanced </b>assesses all analytes in 3409 and 3410 as well as Diamone Oxidase and Total IgE. Diamine Oxidase is the enzyme responsible for clearing histamine in the body and excess histamine may be related to dysfunctional diamine oxidase. Total IgE test measures the amount of IgE antibody in the blood. Allergies are a common condition that affects the body’s immune system. When the body has an allergic reaction, a normally harmless trigger substance such as dust, pollen or specific foods, initiates an immune response via production of an antibody called immunoglobulin IgE. A high detection of Total IgE in a blood sample may mean there are one or more allergies. This test measures the total number of IgE antibodies in the blood, which differs from the specific IgE test that measures IgE responses to various allergens. Total IgE may be elevated in MCAS patients.

N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is a derivative of the dietary amino acid L-cysteine. NAC has a high affinity for lung tissue, which it supports through mucolytic and antioxidant action. Due to its sulfur content, NAC is able to disrupt disulfide bonds within mucus, thinning and easing its expulsion. NAC is a free radical scavenger and thus supports epithelial cell health and healthy cilia activity in the respiratory tract.

NAC is also a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, and supplemental NAC increases tissue levels of glutathione. As fundamental components of the immune system, lymphocytes rely on glutathione to function properly. Tissues enhanced with glutathione support overall antioxidant protection and help to maintain a healthy immune response.

<strong>S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe)</strong>, derived from methionine, is a universal methyl donor involved in methylation reactions. These reactions are crucial for DNA synthesis, mental health, and detoxification.  SAMe also supports joint health, cancer management, and mood regulation, making it a valuable compound for managing conditions like depression, osteoarthritis, and liver disease. SAMe levels reflect the body’s ability to methylate (via methylation), and testing SAMe can help identify potential methylation deficiencies or imbalances.

<strong>S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)</strong> is a precursor to homocysteine and a byproduct of SAMe-dependent methylation reactions. Elevated SAH levels can indicate impaired methylation efficiency, potentially contributing to various health issues, including cardiovascular disease and neurological conditions.

Monitoring SAMe and SAH levels can provide insights into methylation status and guide interventions to support optimal health.

The Female Fertility Profile incorporates test code 1004 to chart female hormone Estradiol and Progesterone through the course of the month, along with an AMH, FSH and LH measurement at the luteal phase of the cycle. Measuring progesterone and estradiol throughout the 28 day cycle can enable the practitioner to assess for deficiencies or an excess of these key hormones during the three phases of the female menstrual cycle (follicular, ovulatory and luteal phases).

<strong>Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH)</strong> is a hormone that is normally produced in the ovaries in females. The level of AMH increases significantly during puberty in women, then it gradually decreases through their reproductive years. AMH is used in the assessment of ovarian fertility. It is used to gauge the ‘ovarian reserve’ or how many eggs a woman has remaining.

<strong>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</strong> promotes the growth and development of the ovarian follicle during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and also contributes to progesterone secretion during the luteal phase.

<strong>Luteinizing Hormone LH –</strong> In conjunction with FSH, a high level of LH mid cycle triggers ovulation and promotes secretion of progesterone and estradiol from the ovaries. Like FSH, LH deficiency or excess may be associated with infertility.
<h3>About The Female Fertility Profile Test</h3>
The test is a simple saliva test that only takes a few minutes every few days over 28 days, the test can be done right from your home or office and is then sent back to the laboratory in the provided express post bag.

The Microbiomix Metagenomic Mapping test utilises metagenomic sequencing (shotgun), a powerful technique for analysing the genetic material of entire microbial communities present in a given stool sample. The term “shotgun” refers to the random and unbiased sequencing of all the genetic material in the sample, including DNA from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms. Covering 28,000+ microbial species, this comprehensive analysis provides a more detailed picture compared to targeted approaches that focus on specific genes or organisms.

Since the sequencing is unbiased, it can reveal the presence of previously unknown or unculturable microorganisms to uncover the full diversity of the microbiome. Through a simple stool sample, this panel will provide detailed information on the microbiome, as well as biochemical markers relating to digestion, inflammation, intestinal permeability and more.

GcMAF is short for <strong>Glycoprotein Macrophage Activating Factor</strong>. It is a complex protein molecule naturally produced within healthy humans. Also referred to as a ‘multifunctional protein’, GcMAF is responsible for initiating and regulating 11 very important cellular and neurological functions within the body. Of these it is the ability to <strong>activate macrophages</strong> which eradicate viruses, tumors, antigens and other unwanted cells from the body. When the body limits/stops naturally producing GcMAF due to a depleted immune system, aging, toxicity so too do these 11 important functions, including the activation of macrophages leaving your immune system unable to fight off pathogens, defend against aging cells and various cancers.
<h3 class=""fusion-responsive-typography-calculated"" data-fontsize=""18"" data-lineheight=""21.6px"">A healthy immune system needs GCMAF</h3>
It is important to understand that GcMAF itself is NOT a treatment method. This is a very common misconception. In a healthy human GcMAF is produced naturally within the Gut (small intestine). These molecules are then integrated into the overall function of the immune system whose primary role is to protect against illness, disease and unwanted cells within the body.
<h3 class=""fusion-responsive-typography-calculated"" data-fontsize=""18"" data-lineheight=""21.6px"">GcMAF as a replacement therapy</h3>
It is only when the body can no longer produce enough GcMAF on its own, that reintroducing it via a bioidentical source, that it can then be considered a ‘replacement therapy’. Unlike other treatment methods, GcMAF is not about introducing a foreign substance to the body – it is simply giving the body back what it should be producing naturally to re-facilitate a healthy immune system.

Dietary MAF (Macrophage Activating Factor) boosts the immunity by activating the immune cells themselves like a nice clear message for your immune system to get to work and the side effect is antiaging.

<h3>Stress: The Modern Epidemic</h3>
According to a recent report from the American Institute of Stress, a large subset of the population is experiencing occasional stress that impacts their lifestyle. One in 10 Americans seek intervention to manage stress-related issues, including to support occasional mood changes, occasional sleeplessness, and lack of energy.
<h3 class=""elementor-image-box-title"">The Gut-Brain Axis and the Psychobiome</h3>
<p class=""elementor-image-box-description"">The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), may play a role in cognitive function, digestion, and mood. Studies show that 80-90% of the fibers in the vagus nerve are linked to the gut, providing a physical link through which the gut microbiota communicate with the brain. Relatedly, the term psychobiome is used to describe the interaction between a person’s collective microbiome and his mental state. A diverse and balanced microbiome can help maintain the gut-brain axis. A psychobiotic is used to describe the commensal bacteria that play a role in the gut-brain axis and support brain health.</p>

<h3 class=""elementor-image-box-title"">1714™: A Trail-blazing Psychobiotic</h3>
<p class=""elementor-image-box-description"">Our solution to supporting the psychobiome uses cutting-edge probiotic technology. 1714™, a unique strain of Bifidobacterium longum, is an up-and-coming psychobiotic that can help support the management of occasional stress and its biochemical expression within the human body. This psychobiotic exerts its effect by targeting the HPA axis to support healthy cortisol levels. 1714™ may support mental health, cognitive process, neurotransmitters, and overall feeling of well-being. In a 4-week human trial, 1714™ reduced perceived stress, improved memory performance, reduced mental fatigue, positively supported brainwave activity, and improved ability to handle occasional stress.</p>

"Nitric Oxide Indicator Strips",nitric-oxide-indicator-strips,,11934,"Nitric Oxide Indicator Strips capture a simple, and non-invasive, saliva sample to determine the concentration of a salivary nitrite, a key biomarker, needed for the production and availability of Nitric Oxide. Each tube contains 25 Indicator Strips.

How to Use:

Step 1: During the morning before you drink or eat, wash your hands and gather saliva on your fingertip.

Step 2: Place the saliva on the indicator strip pad. Don't put the strip in your mouth.

Step 3: Compare your results to the color chart provided. The lighter pink, the more Nitric Oxide deficient you are. 25 strips

Great for checking on heart health!
<h3>NOS &amp; Heart health problems</h3>
NOS gene mutations can cause a reduced production of nitric oxide leading to constricted blood vessels, when this happens, it is harder for your heart to get the oxygen it needs to keep going.  The main concerns with NOS gene mutations are:
<ul>
 	<li>Coronary spasm</li>
 	<li>Heart attack</li>
 	<li>Stroke</li>
 	<li>Blood pressure control</li>
 	<li>Vasculature (arrangement of blood vessels in the body)</li>
 	<li>Migraines</li>
 	<li>Nervous system problems such as learning and memory</li>
 	<li>Immune system problems</li>
 	<li>Free radical damage</li>
 	<li>Infertility</li>
</ul>
<strong>NOS is a balancing act</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Low levels of nitric oxide are bad because they can cause heart problems</li>
 	<li>Too much nitric oxide can be damaging as a result of too many free radicals or free radical damage</li>
</ul>

N.A.D is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It plays a crucial role in <strong>cellular metabolism</strong>, especially in processes like <strong>energy production</strong> and <strong>DNA repair</strong>. NAD exists in two forms:

<strong>NAD+</strong> (oxidized form) – Acts as a carrier for electrons in metabolic reactions. It is essential for converting nutrients into energy by facilitating reactions in cellular respiration, especially in the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain.

<strong>NADH</strong> (reduced form) – This form donates electrons during various biochemical processes, particularly in ATP (energy) production.

<strong>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (N.A.D)</strong>

NAD is also involved in the regulation of <strong>sirtuins</strong>, enzymes that play a role in aging, inflammation, and stress resistance. In recent years, NAD+ has gained attention for its <strong>potential in anti-aging therapies and enhancing mitochondrial function.</strong>
<h3>Symptoms of N.A.D deficiencies</h3>

<h3>OUR BIOME COMMITMENT</h3>
We are committed to using biocompatible ingredients. Therefore, our serum <strong>does not contain any</strong>
<strong>added fragrance.</strong> The compounds used in added fragrances can compromise the skin microbiome.
The expected and unique scent of the SIV™ Biome Balancing Serum is a result of the biocompatible
ingredients used. This clean, earthy scent dissipates quickly.
<h3>SKIN-IDENTICAL INGREDIENTS</h3>
Bacillus is naturally found in nature in the soil and in the ocean. Your skin knows and recognises this bacteria.
The rest of the ingredients are skin-identical fatty acids.
<h3>SQUALANE</h3>
Biomimetic oil, molecule derived from non-GMO sugarcane that mimics squalene, beneficial in promoting skin hydration.
<h3>CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE</h3>
A mixture of caprylic and capric fatty acids derived from coconut oil; helps replenish skin’s surface and helps it to resist moisture loss.
<h3>GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE</h3>
A natural, plant-based, emollient derived from glycerin and plant fatty acids; restores the oils of the skin, regulates the skin moisture and acts as a humidifier to the skin.
<h3>BACILLUS</h3>
A proprietary blend of Bacillus spores activates a healthy skin foundation and visibly improves skin, positively influencing your unique skin biome and establishing balance. Bacillus spores lay dormant in the formula and are designed to activate from the natural heat, oils and water from the skin. This allows the spores to change and improve the skin microbiome by targeting overgrown bacteria while facilitating the growth of other essential species – effectively balancing the skin microbiome.

"DIM + I3C with PQQ Seeking Health",dim-i3c-with-pqq-seeking-health,,12434,"<h4>Are you exposed to plastics, conventional meat and dairy, or conventional household products on a regular basis?  Do you have estrogen dominance?</h4>
All of these have one thing in common - they contain chemicals that may harm human cells and promote free radicals in the body. In the presence of free radicals, estrogenic activity and estrogen metabolism are influenced. Toxin exposure typically affects the endocrine system by increasing estrogen production or estrogen activity. This is called estrogen dominance. The effects of estrogen in high quantities in the body should not be overlooked.

Do you have estrogen dominance? Are you concerned about supporting a healthy hormone balance?<sup>†</sup>

<strong><i>DIM+I3C</i> is a targeted formula that supports healthy estrogen metabolism and a healthy oxidative stress responses associated with xenoestrogen exposure</strong>.<sup>†</sup>

DIM (diindolylmethane) is a byproduct of I3C (indole-3-carbinol), a compound found in broccoli, cabbage and cruciferous vegetables. Both DIM and I3C are dietary indoles, which support normal processing of estrogen metabolites.<sup>†</sup>

A healthy balance between steroid hormones is vital. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and other adrenal hormones and sex hormones (androgens) are incredibly important for reproductive health, sexual health, and overall vitality. However, when estrogen levels get too high from toxin exposure, liver overload, or the use of prescriptions, other important hormones can drop to dangerously low levels. This can put adrenal health, emotional health, and female menses cycles in danger.

PQQ (from Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Disodium Salt) is added to support healthy oxidation of free radicals due to xenoestrogen (chemical estrogen mimickers) exposure and higher estrogen overall. Oxidative stress due to free radicals has a wide impact on all epigenetic controls. Keeping these balanced helps to support the healthy expression of hormone balancing and detoxification genes. Hormones are such a large factor in mental well-being, as they play a part in neurotransmitter balance and feelings of joy.<sup>†</sup>

<i>DIM + I3C</i> can specifically support healthy estrogen metabolism in individuals with high estrogen exposure. The incidence of higher estrogen may be more prevalent in the following individuals:<sup>†</sup>
<ul>
 	<li>Those exposed to toxins and free radicals</li>
 	<li>Those with a change in menopausal status</li>
 	<li>Those on hormonal therapy</li>
 	<li>Premenopausal and postmenopausal women</li>
 	<li>Those taking contraceptives</li>
 	<li>Those at risk for uncontrolled cell growth of the breast tissue</li>
 	<li>Those with abnormal ovarian tissue growth</li>
 	<li>Those struggling with weight issues</li>
</ul>

"Glycoscia - D’ADAMO PN",glycoscia-dadamo-pn,,12668,"<p style=""font-weight: 400;""><b><strong>Unique formula designed to support healthy metabolism, promote weight loss and maintain homeostasis. Inspired by traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</strong></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glycoscia is an innovative, one-of-a-kind nutriceutical formula as an aid to <strong>weight loss, the maintenance of blood sugar levels already in the normal range</strong>, and the overall enhancement of a healthy metabolism.  Glycoscia’s key ingredient is <i><em>Salacia reticulata</em></i>, a traditional herb that has been used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modern research has shown that<i><em> Salacia</em></i> plays an important role in supporting natural carbohydrate metabolism. When we consume sugars and starches, a very small amount is broken down by the enzymes in our saliva. However, by far the greater amount is metabolized in the small intestines, where the assimilated sugar can either be utilized immediately for the production of energy, or saved as fat for later use. One of the ways this is controlled is via special hormones within the cell called PPARs (Pee-Pars). The best studied of the PPARs is called PPAR-gamma (PPARG). PPARG is a key regulator of fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism; sort of like a traffic policeman, directing vehicles in either of two directions: 'burn carbs' or 'store fat.' Studies have shown that <i><em>Salacia</em></i> root exerts a healthful effect on PPARG, helping to maintain and balance its normal, optimal function.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition, in certain individuals, sometimes called 'hyper-assimilators,' a percentage of the undigested carbohydrate from a meal will reach the lower intestine and be broken down into simple sugars, which will then also be assimilated and either stored as fat or burned as energy. These individuals are known to have higher levels of a class of enzymes called glycosidases. <i><em>Salacia</em></i> has been shown to help insure normal, healthy levels of this enzyme, especially when combined with a sensible diet and exercise program.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;""><b><strong>Synergistic Co-Factors</strong></b></p>

<ul style=""font-weight: 400;"">
 	<li><b><strong>Resveratrol</strong></b>: Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, is found primarily in red wine and red grape skins. In a now-famous Harvard study, mice fed resveratrol were reported over time to be thinner and healthier with increased life-spans. Each capsule of Glycoscia supplies a full 50 mg of Resveratrol, providing 50% trans-resveratrol compounds.</li>
 	<li><b><strong>Quercetin:</strong></b> Nature's most important bioflavonoid, Quercetin supports a normal digestive and immune system.</li>
 	<li><b><strong>Red Sage Root (<i><em>Salvia miltiorrhiza</em></i>):</strong></b> Used traditionally in Chinese medicine, recent research in the West confirms <i><em>Salvia</em></i>'s importance in supporting healthy cardiovascular and liver function.</li>
 	<li><b><strong>Maitake Mushroom</strong></b>: Adaptogen considered to be ""The King of Mushrooms."" Research suggests that Maitake appears to maintain blood sugar levels that are already in the normal range.</li>

<p class=""short-description""><strong>Seaweed-based supplement designed to promote optimal metabolic balance and thyroid health.</strong></p>
<em style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong>Dr. Peter D'Adamo:</strong></em>
<div>

<em>""Sea vegetables, and in particular bladderwrack, have many unique characteristics and properties and are used extensively as food in coastal cuisines around the world. It's a positive sign to see this trend building in the Western countries as well.""</em>

</div>
The primary ingredient in Fucus Plus is bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosis) seaweed. The unique composition of bladderwrack includes the unique monosaccharide fucose, and other long-chain sugars known as <strong>high molecular weight polysaccharides</strong>. Readers of Dr. D'Adamo's writings will know that fucose is part of the antigen that determines blood type O and the difference between secretors and non-secretors.

<em style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong>Dr. Peter D'Adamo:</strong></em>
<div>

<em>""All blood types have the sugar fucose as part of their distinguishing antigen. However, types A and B have other sugars as well. Only type O has fucose as the sole identifying antigen. This opens up the possibility that in this blood type fucose can provide a type of blocking protection from invaders that might try to hijack the type O immune system by attaching to its main antigen. ""</em>

</div>
The high molecular weight polysaccharides in Fucus vescuosis include <strong>fucoidin</strong>, which is known to inhibit the growth of many unfriendly bacteria, yeast, and viruses.

<em style=""font-size: 16px;"">""Many chronic conditions are known to be the result of so-called 'stealth infections'. These are often caused by bacteria that can evade the bodys denses by manufacturing biofilms, a type of protective slime. It is known that biofilms do no grow on seaweeds, a defense they've probably had to develop in order to survive the dangerous interface between land and sea.""</em>

This plant was grown and harvested by trained marine botanists and immediately freeze-dried to preserve its molecular integrity. Fucus Plus is suitable for all blood types but may be particularly beneficial to blood type O individuals to help support a healthy digestive system. Bladderwrack may also provide specific benefits, such as helping to maintain a healthy overall body composition and supporting immune system health.

<em style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong>Dr. Peter D'Adamo:</strong></em>
<div>

<em>""Many people are unaware of just how deeply connected the thyroid and digestive tract are -- although it’s long been observed that problems in one organ often carry over to the other. Dr. D’Adamo discovered that a specific seaweed can help optimize and balance this network. ""</em>

</div>
Fucus vesiculosis contains iodine. If you are being treated for a thyroid condition, are allergic to shellfish, or are nursing or pregnant, consult your physician before taking this product.

<strong>Are you a Warrior or a Worrier?</strong>

<strong>Catechol</strong> helps to maintain normal levels and activity of COMT, a critical enzyme that our nervous system, particularly the brain's prefrontal cortex, rely upon to organize and coordinate information from other parts of the brain.

<span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a style=""color: #0000ff;"" href=""https://mthfrgenehealth.com/comt-gene-mutation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">COMT</a></span> is the symbol for the actual enzyme, known as catechol-O-methyltransferase. It is produced chiefly by nerve cells in the brain, but also produced elsewhere in the body,  including the liver, kidneys, and blood, form of the enzyme that helps control the levels of certain hormones.

<em>""In today's modern world, occasional stress can be problematic. This ""slow burn"" can sometimes disrupt our ability to sleep, digest our meals properly, and maintain a healthy immune system. While occasional stress is a body's method of reacting to a challenge, it can also disrupt the body's natural reaction to any stimuli that disturbs its equilibrium, resulting in a fight or flight response. ""</em>

</div>
Maintaining proper and normal COMT activity insures that the prefrontal context of the brain is able to support balanced personality, the ability to plan, the inhibition of negative behaviors, and healthy abstract thinking, emotions, and working (short-term) memory.

<em style=""font-size: 16px;"">""Research indicates that individuals of different ABO blood types can have extremely different responses to occasional stress.

It is not always the usual suspects.. Our Complete 240 Food Panel is our most comprehensive food panel. It can help to identify both common and less obvious foods that may be contributing to inflammation.

Food sensitivities can cause a wide range of symptoms and disorders. The foods that cause these delayed reactions are often hard to diagnose because of the time between consumption and the physical reaction. The IgG food allergy test offers a useful tool for detecting the foods causing this response. The results are patient specific and provide an easy, precise and effective starting point for dietary manipulation.

IgG (immunoglobulin G) testing is a useful guide for practitioners to structure an elimination diet for many chronic health conditions. The foods that cause these delayed reactions are often hard to diagnose because of the time between consumption and the physical reaction. Generally, an IgG reaction occurs hours to days after exposure to these food antigens.

The IgG food allergy test offers a useful tool for detecting the foods causing this response. The results are patient specific and provide an easy, precise and effective starting point for dietary manipulation.

When doing an IgG test, it is recommended to eat a large variety of foods in the two weeks prior to testing. Include as many of the foods that are being tested in the specific allergy panel you have chosen. Be aware that if foods are not included in the diet during this time, false negative results may be obtained as recent exposure to these foods may be required for antibodies to be present in the blood.

It is recommended that IgG allergy testing is only performed for infants greater than 18 months of age.

<h3>Bad Breath?  Consider Oral microbiome Mapping</h3>
The oral microbiome is identified as one of the significant microbial ecosystems in the human body and has the potential to impact our health in various ways. An oral microbiome test Australia can help detect dysbiosis in the oral microbiome, identified through the analysis of genetic material, which can have both local effects (e.g., dental caries, periodontitis, gingivitis, oral cancers), as well as systemic effects (e.g., neurodegeneration, diabetes, cardiovascular disease).

Systemic diseases can arise when pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity translocate into the gut in the presence of oral-gut barrier disruption. Fortunately, many unfavorable symptoms can be reversed by re-establishing symbiosis in the oral microbiome through dietary and lifestyle changes.
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Understanding the Oral Microbiome</h3>
The oral microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microscopic organisms that inhabit the oral cavity. This intricate community includes various species of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms, all playing crucial roles in maintaining oral health. The balance of these organisms is influenced by numerous factors, including diet, lifestyle, and environmental conditions. A healthy oral microbiome is essential for preventing oral diseases and supporting overall well-being.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Oral Microbiome Mapping Techniques</h3>
Oral microbiome mapping techniques involve the use of advanced technologies to analyze the composition and diversity of the oral microbiome. One of the most common methods is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which allows for the precise measurement and quantification of specific microorganisms in the oral cavity. Additionally, next-generation sequencing offers a more comprehensive understanding by identifying a broader range of microbial species. Oral microbiome sequencing further enhances this understanding by providing detailed insights into the microbial communities present. These techniques provide valuable insights into the oral microbiome, helping to identify imbalances and potential health risks.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Connection Between Oral and Gut Microbiome</h3>
The oral microbiome and gut microbiome are intricately connected, with the oral cavity serving as a gateway to the gastrointestinal tract. This connection, often referred to as the oral-gut axis, highlights the significant interplay between these two microbial ecosystems.
<ol class=""wp-block-list"">
 	<li><strong>Oral Cavity Translocate</strong>: Pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity can translocate into the gut, leading to oral-gut barrier disruption. This disruption can have far-reaching consequences, including the development of systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gut Microbiota</strong>: The gut microbiota is composed of trillions of microscopic organisms that work together to maintain a delicate balance. An imbalance of the gut microbiota, also known as dysbiosis, can lead to a range of health issues, including gastrointestinal disease and oral cancers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Short Chain Fatty Acids</strong>: The gut microbiota produces short chain fatty acids, which are essential for maintaining a healthy gut barrier. A decrease in short chain fatty acid production can lead to oral-gut barrier disruption, allowing pathogenic bacteria to translocate into the gut.</li>
 	<li><strong>Opportunistic Pathogens</strong>: Opportunistic pathogens, such as opportunistic bacteria, can take advantage of an imbalance in the oral microbiome and gut microbiome, leading to a range of health issues.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dietary and Lifestyle Changes</strong>: Making dietary and lifestyle changes, such as limiting sugar intake and increasing fiber consumption, can help to promote a healthy balance of the oral microbiome and gut microbiome.</li>
 	<li><strong>Comprehensive Microbiome Test</strong>: A comprehensive microbiome test, such as the Oral Microbiome Mapping test, can provide valuable insights into the balance of the oral microbiome and gut microbiome, allowing for personalized recommendations for improvement.</li>
 	<li><strong>Genetic Material</strong>: The genetic material of the microbes present in the oral cavity and gut can provide valuable information about the balance of the oral microbiome and gut microbiome.</li>
</ol>
By understanding the connection between the oral microbiome and gut microbiome, individuals can take steps to promote a healthy balance of both, leading to improved overall health and well-being.
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Impact on Overall Health</h3>
The oral microbiome imbalance has a significant impact on overall health. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the oral microbiome, can lead to various oral health issues such as dental caries, periodontitis, and oral cancers. Moreover, the oral microbiome is linked to systemic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Disruption of the oral-gut barrier can result in the translocation of pathogenic bacteria from the oral cavity to the gut, contributing to gastrointestinal tract disorders. A comprehensive microbiome test can provide valuable insights into the oral microbiome, helping to identify potential health risks.

When there aren’t enough Lactobacillus probiotics in the vagina, the vaginal pH and microbiome become unbalanced, allowing nonbeneficial yeast and bacteria to grow and thrive. This leads to vaginal discomfort and an abnormal odor.

<h4>How this Helps</h4>
Vaginal Balance contains five Lactobacillus probiotic strains commonly found in healthy vaginas. These probiotic strains lower the vaginal pH and crowd out nonbeneficial microbes, promoting pH balance, vaginal comfort, and normal odor.**

"Copper, Ceruloplasmin & Zinc",copper-ceruloplasmin-zinc,,14248,"<strong>NOTE:  This test is ONLY AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS.</strong>

The Copper, Ceruloplasmin &amp; Zinc profiles provides useful information and is an excellent way to determine immune status and the nutritional intake and/or absorption of zinc and copper.

Zinc is an essential marker for the proper functioning of the immune system. Zinc is required for the activity of over 300 enzymes and is involved in most major metabolic pathways. Either a deficiency or excess in this marker can affect the human body significantly causing a wide variety of symptoms.

The immune system depends on zinc in almost every aspect. Zinc has an inverse relationship with copper in the body. This means that as zinc goes down, copper goes up and the same principle applies vice versa.

Adequate copper levels are essential for the growth of new blood vessels, wound healing, and recovering from heart attacks and strokes. When levels are only slightly above normal physiological amounts, copper can be toxic. Any mild abnormality or impairment of liver function can lead to copper excess.

Ceruloplasmin is an important marker often ordered in conjunction with copper. Caeruloplasmin is a copper-containing enzyme that plays a role in the body’s iron metabolism. The liver binds copper to apocaeruloplasmin to produce caeruloplasmin and then releases it into the bloodstream. About 95 per cent of the copper in the blood is bound to caeruloplasmin.
