<p>A stroke is a serious life-threatening condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is cut-off. Strokes are considered a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential. Blood supply to the brain may be restricted which can lead to brain injury or disability. Two types of strokes are ischaemic, where blood supply is stopped due to a blood clot, or hemorrhagic, where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts.</p>
