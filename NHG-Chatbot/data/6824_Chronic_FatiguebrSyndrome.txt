<p>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) causes persistent fatigue (exhaustion) that affects everyday life and doesn't go away with sleep or rest. CFS is also known as ME, which stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis. There's some debate over the correct term to use for the condition, but these pages will refer to the condition as CFS. CFS is a serious condition that can cause long-term illness and disability, but many people – particularly children and young people – improve over time.</p>
