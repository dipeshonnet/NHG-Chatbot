<h3><strong>Return Policy</strong></h3>
<p>We offer a return policy on products that are classified as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect product/s</strong> - This is in case we shipped the wrong product(s)<br />In the advent that the product shipped is not what was ordered, please notify Customer Service Staff, so a replacement can be sent immediately upon the incorrect product(s) being returned to us. We will require the original item to be sent back to us at our expense before a replacement product can be sent out.</p>
<p><strong>Damaged product/s</strong><br />We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at contact@naturalhealthgroup.com.au and send your item to: Suite 133, 84 Manning Street, Tuncurry, NSW, 2428, Australia.</p>
<p><strong>However:<br /></strong>Nothing we ship is already damaged - the decision to replace a product that has apparently been damaged due to rough mail handling will be at our sole discretion - the customer may have to take up the issue with their local relevant postal body.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping</strong><br />To return your product, you should mail your product to: Suite 133, 84 Manning Street, Tuncurry, NSW, 2428, Australia</p>
<p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>
<p>Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.</p>
<h3><strong>Refund Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Any paid orders unable to be fulfilled in good time will result in a full refund of the initial charge of the relevant item(s).  <strong>Please note that banks charge a fee for refunds (25%), if you do receive a refund bank refund fee/s will be subtracted from your original order.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - <strong>If you accidentally order the wrong product or change your mind, a refund/replacement will NOT be issued.</strong> Please order carefully. Products that have been opened can not be refunded or exchanged.  Test products and services are non-refundable.</p>
