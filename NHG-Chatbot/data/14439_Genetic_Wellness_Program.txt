<p>Often when you have a health problem, health providers through lack of knowledge and misguided focus are looking at the problem, not at the cause and this is followed up with a way to resolve the problem but not address the cause, this strategy usually invites the problem to come back or find another way to cause a new health problem to arise.  This is one of the biggest problems because it perpetuates the cycle of you becoming the victim of the cause and not finding anybody with a real solution to properly solve the underlying cause of the problem.[/vc_column_text][vc_cta h2="Rule No.2" shape="square" style="flat" color="turquoise"]Everybody has genetic mutations, if you don't factor in genetics and how the genetic mutations affect you and your body, you have a zero sum game, e.g. you get poor results.[/vc_cta][vc_column_text]Imagine for a moment that you have a health problem and the solution to solve that health problem relies on your body to deliver special resources that your body makes to solve that problem.  Now imagine for a moment that via genetic mutation you have a loss of function to deliver that solution but you don't know about it, neither does your health provider, what are you going to do to solve the problem?</p>
<p>The truth is this is why most people today have so many health problems, a lack of understanding of what you don't know is stopping you from finding out what you can do to solve the problem.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image="14245" img_size="full" alignment="center"][/vc_column][/vc_row]</p>
